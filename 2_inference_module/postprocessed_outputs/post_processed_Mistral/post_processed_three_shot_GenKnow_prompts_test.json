He was a son of the Frankish statesman Pepin of Herstal and Pepin's mistress, a noblewoman named Alpaida. Charles, also known as “The Hammer” (in old French, \"Martel\"), successfully asserted his claims to power as successor to his father as the power behind the throne in Frankish politics. Continuing and building on his father's work, he restored centralized government in Francia and began the series of military campaigns that re-established the Franks as the undisputed masters of all Gaul.

Text: According to Arthurian legend, Merlin magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy Gorlois, enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois' wife Lady Igraine. Thus Arthur, \"the once and future king\", is an illegitimate child (though later legend, as found in Malory, emphasises that the conception occurred after Gorlois's death and that he was legitimated by Uther's subsequent marriage to Igraine). This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of illegitimate conception is repeated in Arthur's siring of Mordred by his own half-sister Morgause in the 13th century French prose cycles, which was invented by them; it is Mordred who mortally wounds King Arthur in the Battle of Camlann.

Here are a few examples:\nText: Germanicus's uncle and adoptive father, Tiberius, succeeded Augustus as emperor of Rome in AD14. Although Gaius was named after Gaius Julius Caesar, he acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" (meaning \"little [soldier's] boot\") from his father's soldiers during their campaign in Germania. When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Untouched by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted an invitation in 31 to join the emperor on the island of Capri, where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier. Following the death of Tiberius, Caligula succeeded his adoptive grandfather as emperor in 37.

Here are a few examples:\nText: Panic! at the Disco is the solo project of American musician Brendon Urie. It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\" (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\" (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. Ross and Walker subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.

Their third album, \"Survivor\" (2001), whose themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, produced the worldwide hits \"Independent Women\", \"Survivor\" and \"Bootylicious\". In 2001, they announced a hiatus to pursue solo careers. The trio reunited two years later for the release of their fifth and final studio album, \"Destiny Fulfilled\" (2004), which spawned the international hits \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\".

This was especially true of the power pack, which was time-consuming to build and cost twice as much as more conventional designs. Several proposals were made to improve the T-64 with new engines, but chief designer Alexander Morozov's political power in Moscow kept the design in production in spite of any concerns about price. This led to the T-72 being designed as an emergency design, only to be produced in the case of a war, but its 40% lower price led to it entering production in spite of Morozov's objections.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Text: Neferneferuaten Nefertiti () (c. 1370 – c. 1330 BC) was a queen of the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten. Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution, in which they worshipped one god only, Aten, or the sun disc. With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history. Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband's death and before the ascension of Tutankhamun, although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate. If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes. Your answer: ",

Here are a few examples:\nText: Sellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category. Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers \"one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century\".

The club's name comes from Lechia, a poetic name for Poland, and is a continuation of the name used by the club based in Lwów. In their early years, Lechia enjoyed some success, most notably finishing third in the Polish top division, before spending decades in the second and third tiers. In the early 1980s, Lechia won the Polish Cup, the Polish SuperCup, and played in a European competition for the first time. After having two mergers with other teams in the 1990s the club had to restart from the sixth tier in 2001. In May 2008 the club was promoted again to the Ekstraklasa, with the club's most recent success coming in 2019, finishing third in the league and again winning both the Polish Cup and SuperCup.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\" (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. Ross and Walker subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.

Here are a few examples:\nText: Sellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Text: \"Some Like It Hot\" opened to critical and commercial success and is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, winning for Best Costume Design. In 1989, the Library of Congress selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was voted as the top comedy film by the American Film Institute on their list on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs poll in 2000, and was selected as the best comedy of all time in a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017. In 2005, the British Film Institute included this film on its list of \"Top fifty films for children up to the age of 14\". In the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls, it was ranked the 42nd-greatest film ever made in the critics' poll and 37th in the directors' poll. In the earlier 2002 \"Sight & Sound\" polls the film ranked 37th among critics and 24th among directors. In 2010, \"The Guardian\" considered it the 3rd-best comedy film of all time.

Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category. Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers \"one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century\".

The group signed with major label MCA Records to co-distribute its second album, \"Dude Ranch\" (1997). Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. The group's next two releases, \"Enema of the State\" (1999) and \"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket\" (2001), were enormous successes on the strength of radio and MTV airplay. \"Blink-182\" followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group. DeLonge quit in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an \"indefinite hiatus\". They reunited in 2009, producing the trio's sixth album, \"Neighborhoods\" (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited and was replaced by Alkaline Trio frontman Matt Skiba, with their resulting seventh studio album, \"California\", being released on July 1, 2016.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category. Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers \"one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century\".

Text: Despite struggling in the 1880s and 1890s, the Pirates were among the best teams in baseball shortly after the turn of the 20th century. They won three NL titles from 1901 to 1903, played in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and won their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They also won the 1971 World Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \"We Are Family\", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell. After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s, the Pirates struggled mightily over the following decades with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in American professional sports history. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2013 and advanced to the NLDS. The team qualified for the postseason again in 2014 and 2015. The Pirates currently have the sixth-longest World Series championship drought (behind the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Mariners—all except the Indians have never won a World Series), second-longest World Series appearance drought in Major League Baseball (behind only the Mariners, who have never appeared in a World Series), the longest pennant drought in the National League (their most recent showing being their victory in the 1979 World Series), and the longest League Championship Series appearance drought in either league.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category. Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers \"one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century\".

Text: Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal, FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed.

They initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as Bosko and, after losing him, Buddy. The animation studio gained a higher profile, however, after it brought in directors Tex Avery and Chuck Jones and voice actor Mel Blanc.

Here are a few examples:\nText: Early civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Myanmar. In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley, and following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language, culture, and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell to Mongol invasions, and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo dynasty, the country became the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a short period. The early 19th-century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well. The British East India Company seized control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century, and the country became a British colony. After a brief Japanese occupation, Myanmar was reconquered by the Allies and granted independence in 1948.

The Qin Empire later annexed it in 222 BC. Under the late Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty that followed it, Zhejiang's ports became important centers of international trade. It was occupied by the Empire of Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese war and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the Reorganized National Government of China.

After the French took over northern Vietnam through the Tonkin campaign, the various protectorates were consolidated into one union in 1887. Two more entities were incorporated into the union: the Laotian protectorate and the Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan. The French exploited the resources in the region during their rule, but also contributed to improvements of the health and education system in the region. Nevertheless, deep divides remained between the natives and the colonists, leading to sporadic rebellions by the former. After the Fall of France during World War II, the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945, when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime. After the Japanese surrender, the Viet Minh, a communist organization led by Hồ Chí Minh, declared Vietnamese independence, but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina. An all-out independence war, known as the First Indochina War, broke out in late 1946 between French and Viet Minh forces. Your answer: ",

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

In 1996, \"Top of the Pops\" magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. With their \"girl power\" mantra, the Spice Girls redefined the girl group concept by targeting a young female fanbase instead of a male audience. They led the teen pop resurgence of the 1990s and became pop culture icons of the decade.

Text: The Spice Girls were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \"Wannabe\" in 1996; it hit number one in 37 countries and commenced their global success. Their debut album \"Spice\" (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Their follow-up album, \"Spiceworld\" (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 14 million copies worldwide. Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and consistent lyrical theme of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the five members. In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, \"Forever\", was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting. Since then, the group have reunited for two concert tours, the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019), both of which won the \"Billboard\" Live Music Award for the highest-grossing engagements of their respective years.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Text: William Penn (14 October 1644 – 30 July 1718) was an English writer and religious thinker belonging to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, a North American colony of England. He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed. Philadelphia was planned out to be grid-like with its streets and be very easy to navigate, unlike London where Penn was from. The streets are named with numbers and tree names. He chose to use the names of trees for the cross streets because Pennsylvania means \"Penn's Woods\". Your answer: ",

Continuing and building on his father's work, he restored centralized government in Francia and began the series of military campaigns that re-established the Franks as the undisputed masters of all Gaul.

Text: In 1681, King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn's father, the admiral and politician Sir William Penn. This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil, sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, (past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies) in New Castle (now in Delaware) in 1682. On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor, and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held. Afterward, Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia, on the west bank. However, Penn's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch, Swedish colonists, and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware, but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland's proprietor family, the Calverts and Lord Baltimore. These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a \"Pennsylvania\", so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly. Twenty-three years later in 1704, they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware, were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential settlement in the new colony, New Castle, the original Swedish colony town became the capital. Your answer: ",

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Here are a few examples:\nText: Wonder Woman's character was created during World War II; the character in the story was initially depicted fighting Axis forces as well as an assortment of colorful supervillains, although over time her stories came to place greater emphasis on characters, deities, and monsters from Greek mythology. Many stories depicted Wonder Woman freeing herself from bondage, which counterpointed the \"damsels in distress\" trope that was common in comics during the 1940s. In the decades since her debut, Wonder Woman has gained a cast of enemies bent on destroying her, including classic villains such as Ares, Cheetah, Doctor Poison, Circe, Doctor Psycho, and Giganta, along with more recent adversaries such as Veronica Cale and the First Born.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category. Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers \"one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century\".

Text: In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the \"defensive\" team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Your answer: ",

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Text: This is a list of Florida death metal bands. Death metal is a genre of extreme heavy metal music that is characterized by musically by fast, distorted, down-tuned, and sometimes palm-muted guitar instrumentation, growled and screamed vocals, and hyper-fast, blast beat drumming. The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre. The scene declined in the second half of the 1990s but subsequently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Obituary, and Death collectively sold over five-million albums. Your answer: ",

KV4 is notable for being the last royal tomb that was quarried in the Valley and because it has been interpreted as being a workshop used during the official dismantling of the royal necropolis in the early Third Intermediate Period.

It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I.

It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\" (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\" (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style.

Text: Confederate Ireland was the period of Irish Catholic self-government between 1642 and 1649, during the Eleven Years' War. During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press. Confederate ambassadors were appointed and recognised in France, Spain and the Papal States, who supplied the Confederates with money and weapons. Your answer: ",

They eventually declined from the late Paleocene onwards, disappearing from the known fossil record in the late Eocene, though gondwanatheres lived into the Miocene, and may have been multituberculates. More than 200 species are known, ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These species occupied a diversity of ecological niches, ranging from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like arborealism to jerboa-like hoppers. Multituberculates are usually placed as crown mammals outside either of the two main groups of living mammals—Theria, including placentals and marsupials, and Monotremata—but closer to Theria than to monotremes. Nonetheless, at least one study found a potential status as sister taxa to monotremes/Australosphenida.

Here are a few examples:\nText: Sellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Text: Poor Mrs. Jones (1926) is a 46 minute, black and white comedy, drama and family silent film produced by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1925 and released in 1926. It was directed by Raymond Evans, a former newspaperman. Shot on location in Washington, DC and at a farm in Maryland, the film features Gone with the Wind actress Leona Roberts as Jane Jones, a 1920s rural housewife tired of a grueling and unglamorous day-to-day life. She takes a vacation to the city where she stays with her sister Hattie, played by Maud Howell Smith. The USDA produced this film as 1920s propaganda promoting agriculture and farm life as more virtuous and wholesome than life in the city. Your answer: ",

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Text: Dip Top Peak is a 7,291-foot-elevation (2,222 meter) mountain summit located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in eastern King County of Washington state. It is part of the Cascade Range and is set on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The peak is situated north of Mount Daniel, and less than one mile south of Jade Lake. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into East Fork Foss River, which is a tributary of the Skykomish River. The summit saddle has two rock horns, of which the higher southwest peak is the true summit. The first ascent was made August 1950 by Bill and Gene Prater. In the early 1970s, brothers Gene and Bill Prater created the modern aluminum snowshoe known today, and sold them via Bill's \"Sherpa Snowshoes\" company, which proved very popular. Your answer: ",

In other words, the Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern capitalism. In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses Lutherans (especially Pietists, but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, and Moravians (specifically referring to the Herrnhut-based community under Count von Zinzendorf's spiritual lead).

Text: On Liberty is a philosophical essay by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill. Published in 1859, it applies Mill's ethical system of utilitarianism to society and state. Mill suggests standards for the relationship between authority and liberty. He emphasizes the importance of individuality, which he considers prerequisite to the higher pleasures—the \"summum bonum\" of utilitarianism. Furthermore, Mill asserts that democratic ideals may result in the \"tyranny of the majority\". Among the standards proposed are Mill's three basic liberties of individuals, his three legitimate objections to government intervention, and his two maxims regarding the relationship of the individual to society.

Text: The Empire of Trebizond, or Trapezuntine Empire, was a monarchy and one of three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Laskaris and later with the Palaiologos dynasties, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors. Your answer: ",

The Despotate of Epirus had ceased to contest the Byzantine throne even before the Nicaean reconquest and was briefly occupied by the restored Byzantine Empire , thereafter becoming a Serbian dependency later inherited by Italians, ultimately falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1479. Whilst the Empire of Nicaea had restored the Byzantine Empire through restoring control of the capital, it ended in 1453 with the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. Trebizond lasted until 1461 when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered it after a month-long siege and took its ruler and his family into captivity, marking the final end of the Roman imperial tradition initiated by Augustus 1,488 years previously.

The group signed with major label MCA Records to co-distribute its second album, \"Dude Ranch\" (1997). Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. The group's next two releases, \"Enema of the State\" (1999) and \"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket\" (2001), were enormous successes on the strength of radio and MTV airplay. \"Blink-182\" followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group. DeLonge quit in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an \"indefinite hiatus\". They reunited in 2009, producing the trio's sixth album, \"Neighborhoods\" (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited and was replaced by Alkaline Trio frontman Matt Skiba, with their resulting seventh studio album, \"California\", being released on July 1, 2016.

The PPR established a partisan military organization \"Gwardia Ludowa\", later renamed \"Armia Ludowa\".

On 1 January 1944 the party created the State National Council (KRN), proclaimed to be a wartime parliament of Poland; the body was chaired by Bolesław Bierut. In June 1944 the Union of Polish Patriots, a rival to the PPR Polish-communist organization operating in the Soviet Union, recognized the KRN as \"the true representation of the Polish nation\".

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\" (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

After the Northern Crusades, Swedish-speaking peasants started migrating en masse to the coastal areas of present-day Finland, and Espoo was established as a self-governing Catholic parish in the 15th century. In the aftermath of the Finnish War, the establishment of Helsinki as the new capital of the Russian-controlled Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812 greatly benefited the development of the municipality. However, the area remained largely agrarian, until the 20th century.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category. Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers \"one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century\".

In other words, the Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern capitalism. In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses Lutherans (especially Pietists, but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, and Moravians (specifically referring to the Herrnhut-based community under Count von Zinzendorf's spiritual lead).

Text: Despite the obstacles, readers and commentators have reached a broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text \"La Scienza Nuova\" (The New Science), upon which they argue \"Finnegans Wake\" is structured.

Charles, also known as “The Hammer” (in old French, \"Martel\"), successfully asserted his claims to power as successor to his father as the power behind the throne in Frankish politics. Continuing and building on his father's work, he restored centralized government in Francia and began the series of military campaigns that re-established the Franks as the undisputed masters of all Gaul.

Nevertheless, it clearly was founded with the armed support of the French revolutionary forces. The Batavian Republic became a client state, the first of the \"sister-republics\", and later part of the French Empire of Napoleon. Its politics were deeply influenced by the French, who supported no fewer than three \"coups d'état\" to bring the different political factions to power that France favored at different moments in its own political development.

He was a son of the Frankish statesman Pepin of Herstal and Pepin's mistress, a noblewoman named Alpaida. Charles, also known as “The Hammer” (in old French, \"Martel\"), successfully asserted his claims to power as successor to his father as the power behind the throne in Frankish politics. Continuing and building on his father's work, he restored centralized government in Francia and began the series of military campaigns that re-established the Franks as the undisputed masters of all Gaul.

The T-34 had a profound effect on the conflict on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, and had a lasting impact on tank design. After the Germans encountered the tank in 1941, German general Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist called it \"the finest tank in the world\" and Heinz Guderian affirmed the T-34's \"vast superiority\" over German tanks. Alfred Jodl, chief of operations staff of the German armed forces noted in his war diary \"the surprise at this new and thus unknown \"wunder\"-armament being unleashed against the German assault divisions.\" Although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war, it has been described as the most influential tank design of the war.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

In response, the Nazi authorities suppressed the OUN leadership. In October 1942 the OUN-B established the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA).

Text: Located on the Brunswick Peninsula north of the Strait of Magellan, Punta Arenas was originally established by the Chilean government in 1848 as a tiny penal colony to assert sovereignty over the Strait. During the remainder of the 1800s, Punta Arenas grew in size and importance due to the increasing maritime traffic and trade travelling to the west coasts of South and North America. This period of growth also resulted from the waves of European immigrants, mainly from Croatia and Russia attracted to the gold rush and sheep farming boom in the 1880s and early 1900s.
