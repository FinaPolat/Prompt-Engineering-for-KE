During the Second World War, Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy, and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points. The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics, and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing, Cornish pilot gig rowing, sea kayaking and powerboating. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Neolithic', 'Romans', 'Dorset', 'Celtic tribe', 'Early Middle Ages', 'Saxons', 'shire', '7', 'Viking', 'Black Death', 'Melcombe Regis', '1348', 'English Civil War', 'vigilantes', 'Oliver Cromwell', 'Shaftesbury', 'Monmouth Rebellion', 'Lyme Regis', 'Tolpuddle', 'trade union movement', 'Second World War', 'invasion of Normandy', 'Portland', 'Poole', '2012 Summer Olympics', '2012', 'sailing', 'Cornish pilot gig', 'sea kayak', 'powerboating'] What do you know about the entities?

[['Poole', 'location', 'Early Middle Ages'], ['Portland', 'Location', 'Dorset'], ['trade union movement', 'participant', 'Early Middle Ages'], ['English Civil War', 'Participant', 'Oliver Cromwell']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Poole', 'location', 'Early Middle Ages'], ['trade union movement', 'participant', 'Early Middle Ages']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - location - does not hold between Poole and Early Middle Ages.', 'The relation - participant - does not hold between trade union movement and Early Middle Ages.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['English Civil War', 'Participant', 'Oliver Cromwell'], ['Portland', 'Location', 'Dorset']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Middlesex (; abbreviation: Middx) is a historic county in southeast England. Its area is almost entirely within the wider urbanised area of London and mostly within the ceremonial county of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring ceremonial counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon period from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official administrative unit until 1965. The county is bounded to the south by the River Thames, and has the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills forming its other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. Your answer: ",

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Chevrolet ( ), colloquially referred to as Chevy and formally the Chevrolet Division of General Motors Company, is an American automobile division of the American manufacturer General Motors (GM). Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3, 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918, and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Chevrolet', 'American automobile', 'General Motors', 'Louis Chevrolet', 'William C.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Henry Ford', 'inception', 'Alfred Sloan'], ['1929', 'country', 'Louis Chevrolet']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - inception - does not hold between Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan.', 'The relation - country - does not hold between 1929 and Louis Chevrolet.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Chevrolet', 'Owned by', 'General Motors'], ['Chevrolet', 'Founded by', 'Louis Chevrolet'], ['Chevrolet', 'founded by', 'William C.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Called \"the biggest British rock band of the 80s\" by \"Classic Rock\" magazine, their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia. Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (Best British Group twice), two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other awards.

The newer work reflected his experiences and impressions during a period when his wife, who was suffering from a lung complaint, resided at Dr. Friedrich Jessen's \"Waldsanatorium\" in Davos, Switzerland for several months. In May and June 1912, Mann visited her and became acquainted with the team of doctors and patients in this cosmopolitan institution. According to Mann, in the afterword that was later included in the English translation of his novel, this stay inspired his opening chapter (\"Arrival\"). Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['The Magic Mountain', '1912', 'Death in Venice', 'novella', 'Davos', 'June 1912'] What do you know about the entities? ['1912 is a/an date.', 'Novella is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['genre'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['June 1912', 'genre', 'The Magic Mountain'], ['novella', 'genre', 'novella'], ['Death in Venice', 'Genre', 'novella']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['novella', 'genre', 'novella'], ['June 1912', 'genre', 'The Magic Mountain']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - genre - does not hold between novella and novella.', 'The relation - genre - does not hold between June 1912 and The Magic Mountain.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Death in Venice', 'Genre', 'novella']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" ( ) is a literary folktale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, about a vain emperor who gets exposed before his subjects.

This was especially true of the power pack, which was time-consuming to build and cost twice as much as more conventional designs. Several proposals were made to improve the T-64 with new engines, but chief designer Alexander Morozov's political power in Moscow kept the design in production in spite of any concerns about price. This led to the T-72 being designed as an emergency design, only to be produced in the case of a war, but its 40% lower price led to it entering production in spite of Morozov's objections.

It provided the inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film \"Apocalypse Now\".

Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: The Seventh Seal () is a 1957 Swedish historical fantasy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play \"Wood Painting\". The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\". Here, the motif of silence refers to the \"silence of God\", which is a major theme of the film. Your answer: ",

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Chandler's treatment of the detective novel exhibits an effort to develop the form. His first full-length book, \"The Big Sleep\", was published when Chandler was 51; his last, \"Playback\" when he was 70. Seven novels were produced in the last two decades of his life. An eighth, \"Poodle Springs\", was completed posthumously by Robert B. Parker and published years later. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['51', 'Playback', '70', 'Poodle Springs', 'Robert B. Parker'] What do you know about the entities? ['51 is a/an number.', '70 is a/an number.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['author'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Poodle Springs', 'Author', 'Robert B.

Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - author - does not hold between 51 and 70.', 'The relation - author - does not hold between Robert B. Parker and Robert B.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Adobe InDesign is a desktop publishing and typesetting software application produced by Adobe Inc.. It can be used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and ebooks. InDesign can also publish content suitable for tablet devices in conjunction with Adobe Digital Publishing Suite. Graphic designers and production artists are the principal users, creating and laying out periodical publications, posters, and print media. It also supports export to EPUB and SWF formats to create e-books and digital publications, including digital magazines, and content suitable for consumption on tablet computers. In addition, InDesign supports XML, style sheets, and other coding markup, making it suitable for exporting tagged text content for use in other digital and online formats.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Ninazu in Sumerian religion was a god of the underworld, and of healing. He was the son of Ninlil and Enlil or, in alternative traditions, of Ereshkigal and Gugalana. His wife is oftentimes depicted as the goddess Ninigirida and their son was Ningiszida. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Ninazu', 'Sumerian religion', 'underworld', 'Ninlil', 'Enlil', 'Ereshkigal', 'Gugalana', 'Ningiszida'] What do you know about the entities? ['Underworld is a/an unknown.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['spouse'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Ninlil', 'Spouse', 'Enlil'], ['underworld', 'spouse', 'Ningiszida'], ['Ningiszida', 'spouse', 'Enlil']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Ningiszida', 'spouse', 'Enlil'], ['underworld', 'spouse', 'Ningiszida']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - spouse - does not hold between Ningiszida and Enlil.', 'The relation - spouse - does not hold between underworld and Ningiszida.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Ninlil', 'Spouse', 'Enlil']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Neferneferuaten Nefertiti () (c. 1370 – c. 1330 BC) was a queen of the 18th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten. Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution, in which they worshipped one god only, Aten, or the sun disc. With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history. Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband's death and before the ascension of Tutankhamun, although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate. If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes. Your answer: ",

I hope it is correct. \n\nNote: The triple ['Swiss International Air Lines', 'took over', 'Swissair'] is incorrect because the text does not mention Swiss International Air Lines taking over Swissair. The triple ['Crossair','renamed itself', 'Swiss International Air Lines'] is also incorrect because the text does not mention Crossair renaming itself as Swiss International Air Lines. The triple ['Swiss International Air Lines', 'took over', 'Swissair'] is also incorrect because the text does not mention Swiss International Air Lines taking over Swissair. Therefore, the final answer is [['Lufthansa', 'took over', 'Swiss International Air Lines'], ['Swissair Group', 'is being liquidated', '']]. \n\nHere's how I think like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples:\n\n1. I start by identifying the entities mentioned in the text, which are ['Swiss International Air Lines', 'Swissair', 'Crossair', 'Lufthansa', 'Swissair Group', 'April 1, 2002', '2005'].\n\n2. I then identify the potential relations between these entities, which are ['renamed itself', 'took over', 'is being liquidated','still exists', 'took over'].\n\n3. I then create a draft of the triples based on the entities and relations I have identified.\n\n4. I then filter out the incorrect triples based on my understanding of the domain. For example, I know that 'Swiss International Air Lines' did not take over 'Swissair', so the triple ['Swiss International Air Lines', 'took over', 'Swissair'] is incorrect. I also know that 'Crossair' did not rename itself as 'Swiss International Air Lines', so the triple ['Crossair','renamed itself', 'Swiss International Air Lines'] is incorrect.\n\n5. Finally,",

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The Crying of Lot 49 is a novel written by American author Thomas Pynchon and published in 1965. The shortest of Pynchon's novels, its narrative follows Oedipa Maas, a young Californian woman, who begins to embrace a conspiracy theory as she possibly unearths a centuries-old conflict between two mail distribution companies; one of these companies, Thurn and Taxis, actually existed (1806–1867) and was the first private firm to distribute postal mail. Like most of Pynchon's output, \"Lot 49\" is often described as postmodernist literature. \"Time\" included the novel in its \"TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\".

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The software was originally designed at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) in the early 1980s. The name originates as an acronym of \"Berkeley Internet Name Domain\", reflecting the application's use within UCB. The latest version is BIND 9, first released in 2000 and still actively maintained by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) with new releases issued several times a year. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['University of California, Berkeley', '1980', 'BIND', '9', '2000', 'Internet Systems Consortium'] What do you know about the entities? ['1980 is a/an date.', '9 is a/an number.', '2000 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['manufacturer'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['BIND', 'manufacturer', '1980'], ['BIND', 'Manufacturer', 'Internet Systems Consortium'], ['2000', 'manufacturer', '2000']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['BIND', 'manufacturer', '1980'], ['2000', 'manufacturer', '2000']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - manufacturer - does not hold between BIND and 1980.', 'The relation - manufacturer - does not hold between 2000 and 2000.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['BIND', 'Manufacturer', 'Internet Systems Consortium']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Baidu, Inc. (, meaning \"hundred times\", anglicized ) is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products and artificial intelligence (AI), headquartered in Beijing's Haidian District. It is one of the largest AI and Internet companies in the world. The holding company of the group is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Baidu was incorporated in January 2000 by Robin Li and Eric Xu. The Baidu search engine is currently the fourth largest website in the Alexa Internet rankings.

The company was founded on 28 March 1882, by Paul Carl Beiersdorf. In 1890, it was sold to Oscar Troplowitz. Troplowitz worked with Beiersdorf's associate, Dr Paul Gerson Unna, and the German chemist Isaac Lifschütz, developed a new skin care cream. In 1900, Lifschütz developed the first stable water-in-oil emulsion, Eucerit. This was the origin of Eucerin. \"Nivea\" comes from the Latin adjective \"niveus, nivea, niveum\", meaning \"snow-white\". Your answer: ",

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports drama film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. The film co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Burt Young, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki. \"Rocky IV\" was the highest-grossing sports movie of all time for 24 years, before it was overtaken by \"The Blind Side\".

Let's use an example:\nText: Omaha, commonly known as Omaha Beach, was the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944, during World War II. \"Omaha\" refers to an section of the coast of Normandy, France, facing the English Channel, from east of Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes to west of Vierville-sur-Mer on the right bank of the Douve River estuary. Landings here were necessary to link the British landings to the east at Gold with the American landing to the west at Utah, thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the Bay of the Seine. Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army troops, with sea transport, mine sweeping, and a naval bombardment force provided predominantly by the United States Navy and Coast Guard, with contributions from the British, Canadian and Free French navies.

The domain expert's task is to validate the triples and add or modify them based on their knowledge. \n\nIn this case, the triples seem to be accurate and relevant to the text. They describe the film \"Hiroshima mon amour\" as a work directed by Alain Resnais, with a screenplay by Marguerite Duras, and as a co-production between France and Japan. The triple \"Hiroshima mon amour, 'Document','memory'\" is also relevant, as the film is about a personal conversation between a French-Japanese couple about memory. The triple \"Hiroshima mon amour, 'Topic', 'French-Japanese couple'\" is not as relevant, as it is not directly mentioned in the text.

The club was founded in 1945 by people expelled from Lwów, who were supporters of Poland's oldest football team Lechia Lwów, founded in 1903. The club's name comes from Lechia, a poetic name for Poland, and is a continuation of the name used by the club based in Lwów. In their early years, Lechia enjoyed some success, most notably finishing third in the Polish top division, before spending decades in the second and third tiers. In the early 1980s, Lechia won the Polish Cup, the Polish SuperCup, and played in a European competition for the first time. After having two mergers with other teams in the 1990s the club had to restart from the sixth tier in 2001. In May 2008 the club was promoted again to the Ekstraklasa, with the club's most recent success coming in 2019, finishing third in the league and again winning both the Polish Cup and SuperCup.

Here are the triples that I extracted:\n\n* [['Lechia Gdańsk', 'Country', 'Poland']]: This triple is based on the sentence \"Lechia Gdańsk is a Polish football club based in Gdańsk.\" The relation 'country' is inferred because the text explicitly states that Lechia Gdańsk is a Polish football club.\n* [['Lechia Gdańsk', 'Sport', 'football']]: This triple is based on the sentence \"Lechia Gdańsk is a Polish football club based in Gdańsk.\" The relation'sport' is inferred because the text explicitly states that Lechia Gdańsk is a football club.\n* [['Lechia Gdańsk', 'Headquarters location', 'Gdańsk']]: This triple is based on the sentence \"Lechia Gdań",

The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, winning for Best Costume Design. In 1989, the Library of Congress selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was voted as the top comedy film by the American Film Institute on their list on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs poll in 2000, and was selected as the best comedy of all time in a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017. In 2005, the British Film Institute included this film on its list of \"Top fifty films for children up to the age of 14\". In the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls, it was ranked the 42nd-greatest film ever made in the critics' poll and 37th in the directors' poll. In the earlier 2002 \"Sight & Sound\" polls the film ranked 37th among critics and 24th among directors. In 2010, \"The Guardian\" considered it the 3rd-best comedy film of all time.

Text: As a hub of commercial aviation, Long Island is home to two of the New York City metropolitan area's three busiest airports, JFK International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, in addition to Islip MacArthur Airport; as well as two major air traffic control radar facilities, the New York TRACON and the New York ARTCC. Nine bridges and thirteen tunnels (including railroad tunnels) connect Brooklyn and Queens to the three other boroughs of New York City. Ferries connect Suffolk County northward across Long Island Sound to the state of Connecticut. The Long Island Rail Road is the busiest commuter railroad in North America and operates 24/7. Nassau County high school students often feature prominently as winners of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair and similar STEM-based academic awards. Biotechnology companies and scientific research play a significant role in Long Island's economy, including research facilities at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Stony Brook University, New York Institute of Technology, Plum Island Animal Disease Center, the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the City University of New York, and Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine.

The human impact on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for the future evolution of living species, including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence, or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of the human impact. In July 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene epoch into three distinct subsections, Greenlandian (11,700 years ago to 8,200 years ago), Northgrippian (8,200 years ago to 4,200 years ago) and Meghalayan (4,200 years ago to the present), as proposed by International Commission on Stratigraphy.

['Holocene', 'Instance of', 'epoch']\nReasoning: The text states that the Holocene corresponds with the rapid proliferation, growth and impacts of the human species worldwide, which suggests that it is an epoch.\n\n2. ['Human', 'Instance of','species']\nReasoning: The text mentions the human species, which is a type of species.\n\n3. ['Holocene', 'Part of', 'geologic timescale']\nReasoning: The text does not explicitly state that the Holocene is part of the geologic timescale, but it is implied since it is mentioned as an epoch.\n\n4. ['Human', 'Part of', 'Holocene']\nReasoning: The text states that the human impact on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for the future evolution of living species, which suggests that the human species is part of the Holocene epoch.\n\n5. ['Greenlandian', 'Part of', 'Holocene']\nReasoning: The text states that the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene epoch into three distinct subsections, including the Greenlandian, which implies that the Greenlandian is part of the Holocene.\n\n6. ['Northgrippian', 'Part of', 'Holocene']\nReasoning: Similar to the previous triple, the Northgrippian is also part of the Holocene.\n\n7. ['Meghalayan', 'Part of', 'Holocene']\nReasoning: The same reasoning applies to the Meghalayan, which is also part of the Holocene.\n\n8. ['Mawmluh cave', 'Location of', 'boundary stratotype of Meghalayan']\nReasoning: The text states that the boundary stratotype of the Meghalayan is a speleothem in Mawmluh cave in India, which implies that Mawmluh cave is the location of the boundary stratotype.\n\n9. ['Mount Logan', 'Location of', 'global auxiliary stratotype']\nReasoning: The text states that the global auxiliary stratotype is an ice core from Mount Logan in Canada, which implies that Mount Logan is the location of the global auxiliary stratotype.\n\n10.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the second novel in the \"Harry Potter\" series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the \"Chamber of Secrets\" has been opened and that the \"heir of Slytherin\" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'fantasy novel', 'J. K. Rowling', 'Harry Potter', 'Harry', 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry', 'Chamber of Secrets', 'Slytherin', 'Ron', 'Hermione'] What do you know about the entities? ['Fantasy novel is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['author', 'characters', 'notable work'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['J. K.

Rowling'], ['Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'Characters', 'Harry'], ['Ron', 'notable work', 'Harry Potter']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Ron', 'notable work', 'Harry Potter'], ['Harry Potter', 'notable work', 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - notable work - does not hold between Ron and Harry Potter.', 'The relation - notable work - does not hold between Harry Potter and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'Author', 'J. K. Rowling'], ['Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', 'Characters', 'Harry'], ['J. K. Rowling', 'Notable work', 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'], ['J. K. Rowling', 'notable work', 'Harry Potter'], ['Harry Potter', 'author', 'J. K. Rowling']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Excalibur () is the legendary sword of King Arthur, sometimes also attributed with magical powers or associated with the rightful sovereignty of Britain. It was associated with the Arthurian legend very early on. Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone (the proof of Arthur's lineage) are in some versions said to be different, though in most incarnations they are the same. In Welsh, it is called \"Caledfwlch\"; in Cornish, \"Calesvol\" (in Modern Cornish: \"Kalesvolgh\"); in Breton, \"Kaledvoulc'h\"; and in Latin, \"Caliburnus\". Your answer: ",

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Mann started writing what was to become \"The Magic Mountain\" in 1912. It began as a much shorter narrative which revisited in a comic manner aspects of \"Death in Venice\", a novella that he was preparing for publication. The newer work reflected his experiences and impressions during a period when his wife, who was suffering from a lung complaint, resided at Dr. Friedrich Jessen's \"Waldsanatorium\" in Davos, Switzerland for several months. In May and June 1912, Mann visited her and became acquainted with the team of doctors and patients in this cosmopolitan institution. According to Mann, in the afterword that was later included in the English translation of his novel, this stay inspired his opening chapter (\"Arrival\"). Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['The Magic Mountain', '1912', 'Death in Venice', 'novella', 'Davos', 'June 1912'] What do you know about the entities? ['1912 is a/an date.', 'Novella is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['genre'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['June 1912', 'genre', 'The Magic Mountain'], ['novella', 'genre', 'novella'], ['Death in Venice', 'Genre', 'novella']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['novella', 'genre', 'novella'], ['June 1912', 'genre', 'The Magic Mountain']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - genre - does not hold between novella and novella.', 'The relation - genre - does not hold between June 1912 and The Magic Mountain.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Death in Venice', 'Genre', 'novella']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['American football', 'part of', 'Super Bowl'], ['Chicago Bears', 'sport', 'American football']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - part of - does not hold between American football and Super Bowl.', 'The relation - sport - does not hold between Chicago Bears and American football.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Chicago Bears', 'Sport', 'American football'], ['Chicago Bears', 'Member of', 'National Football League'], ['Chicago Bears', 'Part of', 'North'], ['National Football Conference', 'part of', 'National Football League'], ['North', 'part of', 'National Football Conference']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

For example, 'Star Wars' cannot occupy'media', it is'media' itself. 'Star Wars' did not begin '1977 film', it is the '1977 film' itself. 'Star Wars' did not become 'worldwide pop-culture phenomenon', it is the phenomenon that 'Star Wars' became. 'Star Wars' did not expand 'various films and other media', it is the media that 'Star Wars' expanded into. Similarly, 'Star Wars' does not include 'television series",

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The Chicago Bears are a professional American football team based in Chicago. The Bears compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. The Bears have won nine NFL Championships, including one Super Bowl, and hold the NFL record for the most enshrinees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the most retired jersey numbers. The Bears have also recorded more victories than any other NFL franchise. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Chicago Bears', 'American football', 'Chicago', 'National Football League', 'National Football Conference', 'North', 'NFL Championships', 'Super Bowl', 'Pro Football Hall of Fame', 'retired jersey'] What do you know about the entities? ['Retired jersey is a/an unknown.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['sport', 'member of', 'part of'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Chicago Bears', 'sport', 'American football'], ['Chicago Bears', 'Member of', 'National Football League'], ['North', 'part of', 'National Football Conference'], ['National Football Conference', 'part of', 'National Football League'], ['American football', 'part of', 'Super Bowl'], ['Chicago Bears', 'Part of', 'North'], ['Chicago Bears', 'Sport', 'American football']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['American football', 'part of', 'Super Bowl'], ['Chicago Bears', 'sport', 'American football']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - part of - does not hold between American football and Super Bowl.', 'The relation - sport - does not hold between Chicago Bears and American football.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Chicago Bears', 'Sport', 'American football'], ['Chicago Bears', 'Member of', 'National Football League'], ['Chicago Bears', 'Part of', 'North'], ['National Football Conference', 'part of', 'National Football League'], ['North', 'part of', 'National Football Conference']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Despite struggling in the 1880s and 1890s, the Pirates were among the best teams in baseball shortly after the turn of the 20th century. They won three NL titles from 1901 to 1903, played in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and won their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They also won the 1971 World Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \"We Are Family\", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell. After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s, the Pirates struggled mightily over the following decades with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in American professional sports history. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2013 and advanced to the NLDS. The team qualified for the postseason again in 2014 and 2015. The Pirates currently have the sixth-longest World Series championship drought (behind the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Mariners—all except the Indians have never won a World Series), second-longest World Series appearance drought in Major League Baseball (behind only the Mariners, who have never appeared in a World Series), the longest pennant drought in the National League (their most recent showing being their victory in the 1979 World Series), and the longest League Championship Series appearance drought in either league. From 1882 to 2020, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,564–10,446 ( winning 'percentage') Your answer: ",

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: In the Middle Ages, Montpellier was an important city of the Crown of Aragon (and was the birthplace of James I), and then of Majorca, before its sale to France in 1349. Established in 1220, the University of Montpellier is one of the oldest universities in the world and oldest medical school still in operation, with notable alumni such as Petrarch, Nostradamus and François Rabelais. Above the medieval city, the ancient citadel of Montpellier is a stronghold built in the seventeenth century by Louis XIII of France.  Let's extract the entities first.

A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The name \"Blue Jays\" originates from the bird of the same name, and blue is also the traditional colour of Toronto's collegiate and professional sports teams including the Maple Leafs (ice hockey) and the Argonauts (Canadian football). In 1976, out of the over 4,000 suggestions, 154 people selected the name \"Blue Jays.\" In addition, the team was originally owned by the Labatt Brewing Company, makers of the popular beer Labatt Blue. Colloquially nicknamed the \"Jays\", the team's official colours are royal blue, navy blue, red, and white. An expansion franchise, the club was founded in Toronto in 1977. Originally based at Exhibition Stadium, the team began playing its home games at SkyDome upon its opening in 1989. Since 2000, the Blue Jays have been owned by Rogers Communications and in 2004, SkyDome was purchased by that company, which renamed it Rogers Centre. They are the second MLB franchise to be based outside the United States, and currently the only team based outside the U.S. after the first Canadian franchise, the Montreal Expos, became the Washington Nationals in 2005.

In 2001, at the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner in the largest merger in U.S. history.

Text: Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal, FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed.

Let's use an example:\nText: The history of the region begins with the kingdom of Paeonia, a mixed Thraco-Illyrian polity. In the late sixth century BC, the area was subjugated by the Persian Achaemenid Empire, then incorporated into the kingdom of Macedonia in the fourth century BC. The Romans conquered the region in the second century BC and made it part of the larger province of Macedonia. The area remained part of the Byzantine Empire, but was often raided and settled by Slavic tribes beginning in the sixth century of the Christian era. Following centuries of contention between the Bulgarian, Byzantine, and Serbian Empire, it was part of the Ottoman dominion from the mid-14th until the early 20th century, when, following the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, the modern territory of North Macedonia came under Serbian rule.

Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['kingdom of Paeonia', 'Thraco', 'Illyrian', 'Achaemenid Empire', 'kingdom of Macedonia', 'The Romans', 'Macedonia', 'Byzantine Empire', 'Slavic tribes', 'centuries of contention', 'Bulgarian', 'Serbian Empire', 'Ottoman', '-14', '20', 'Balkan Wars', '1912', '1913', 'North Macedonia', 'Serbian'] What do you know about the entities? ['Kingdom of paeonia is a/an location.', 'Kingdom of macedonia is a/an location.', 'Centuries of contention is a/an media.', '-14 is a/an number.', '20 is a/an number.', '1912 is a/an date.', '1913 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['follows', 'participant'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Illyrian', 'participant', '1912'], ['Balkan Wars', 'Participant', 'Ottoman'], ['Balkan Wars', 'participant', 'Serbian'], ['kingdom of Macedonia', 'Follows', 'Achaemenid Empire'], ['Ottoman', 'follows', '-14']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Illyrian', 'participant', '1912'], ['Ottoman', 'follows', '-14']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - participant - does not hold between Illyrian and 1912.', 'The relation - follows - does not hold between Ottoman and -14.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['kingdom of Macedonia', 'Follows', 'Achaemenid Empire'], ['Balkan Wars', 'Participant', 'Ottoman'], ['Balkan Wars', 'participant', 'Serbian']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Lycia fought for the Persians in the Persian Wars, but on the defeat of the Achaemenid Empire by the Greeks, it became intermittently a free agent. After a brief membership in the Athenian Empire, it seceded and became independent (its treaty with Athens had omitted the usual non-secession clause), was under the Persians again, revolted again, was conquered by Mausolus of Caria, returned to the Persians, and finally fell under Macedonian hegemony upon the defeat of the Persians by Alexander the Great. Due to the influx of Greek speakers and the sparsity of the remaining Lycian speakers, Lycia was rapidly Hellenized under the Macedonians, and the Lycian language disappeared from inscriptions and coinage.

After the French took over northern Vietnam through the Tonkin campaign, the various protectorates were consolidated into one union in 1887. Two more entities were incorporated into the union: the Laotian protectorate and the Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan. The French exploited the resources in the region during their rule, but also contributed to improvements of the health and education system in the region. Nevertheless, deep divides remained between the natives and the colonists, leading to sporadic rebellions by the former. After the Fall of France during World War II, the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945, when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime. After the Japanese surrender, the Viet Minh, a communist organization led by Hồ Chí Minh, declared Vietnamese independence, but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina. An all-out independence war, known as the First Indochina War, broke out in late 1946 between French and Viet Minh forces. Your answer: ",

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Adobe InDesign is a desktop publishing and typesetting software application produced by Adobe Inc.. It can be used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and ebooks. InDesign can also publish content suitable for tablet devices in conjunction with Adobe Digital Publishing Suite. Graphic designers and production artists are the principal users, creating and laying out periodical publications, posters, and print media. It also supports export to EPUB and SWF formats to create e-books and digital publications, including digital magazines, and content suitable for consumption on tablet computers. In addition, InDesign supports XML, style sheets, and other coding markup, making it suitable for exporting tagged text content for use in other digital and online formats. The Adobe InCopy word processor uses the same formatting engine as InDesign. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Adobe InDesign', 'desktop publishing', 'typesetting', 'application', 'Adobe Inc.', 'EPUB', 'SWF', 'tablet computer', 'XML', 'Adobe InCopy'] What do you know about the entities? ['Desktop publishing is a/an concept.', 'Typesetting is a/an concept.', 'Application is a/an concept.', 'Tablet computer is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['manufacturer'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Adobe InDesign', 'Manufacturer', 'Adobe Inc.'], ['Adobe InDesign', 'manufacturer', 'typesetting'], ['typesetting', 'manufacturer', 'SWF']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Adobe InDesign', 'manufacturer', 'typesetting'], ['typesetting', 'manufacturer', 'SWF']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - manufacturer - does not hold between Adobe InDesign and typesetting.', 'The relation - manufacturer - does not hold between typesetting and SWF.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Adobe InDesign', 'Manufacturer', 'Adobe Inc.']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Creative Commons (CC) is an American non-profit organization and international network devoted to educational access and expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon legally and to share. The organization has released several copyright licenses, known as Creative Commons licenses, free of charge to the public. These licenses allow authors of creative works to communicate which rights they reserve and which rights they waive for the benefit of recipients or other creators. An easy-to-understand one-page explanation of rights, with associated visual symbols, explains the specifics of each Creative Commons license. Creative Commons licenses do not replace copyright, but are based upon it. They replace individual negotiations for specific rights between copyright owner (licensor) and licensee, which are necessary under an \"all rights reserved\" copyright management, with a \"some rights reserved\" management employing standardized licenses for re-use cases where no commercial compensation is sought by the copyright owner.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: East Rutherford is the home of the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which includes Meadowlands Arena and MetLife Stadium, and was previously the location of Giants Stadium. The arena is best known as the former home of the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association and the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League, and also hosted college basketball, arena football, concerts, and other events. MetLife Stadium is home of the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL), the New York Guardians of the XFL, and hosted Super Bowl XLVIII, which made East Rutherford the smallest city ever to host a Super Bowl. Giants Stadium, which hosted the Giants and Jets until 2009, was also the original home of the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer. East Rutherford is the only municipality with fewer than 10,000 residents to have been home to five professional sports teams simultaneously. Let's extract the entities first.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The Cure are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex, in 1978. Throughout numerous lineup changes since the band's formation, guitarist, lead vocalist, and songwriter Robert Smith has remained the only constant member. The band's debut album was \"Three Imaginary Boys\" (1979) and this, along with several early singles, placed the band in the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the United Kingdom. Beginning with their second album, \"Seventeen Seconds\" (1980), the band adopted a new, increasingly dark and tormented style, which, together with Smith's stage look, had a strong influence on the emerging genre of gothic rock as well as the subculture that eventually formed around the genre. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['The Cure', 'rock', 'Crawley, West Sussex', '1978', 'Robert Smith', 'Three Imaginary Boys', '1979', 'post-punk', 'new wave', 'Seventeen Seconds', '1980', 'gothic rock', 'the subculture'] What do you know about the entities?

Let's use an example:\nText: Japheth ( \"Yép̄eṯ\", in pausa \"Yā́p̄eṯ\"; \"\"; ) is one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis, in which he plays a role in the story of Noah's drunkenness and the curse of Ham, and subsequently in the Table of Nations as the ancestor of the peoples of the Aegean Sea, Anatolia, and elsewhere. In medieval and early modern European tradition he was considered to be the progenitor of the European peoples. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Japheth', 'pausa', 'sons of Noah', 'Book of Genesis', 'curse of Ham', 'Table of Nations', 'Aegean Sea', 'Anatolia', 'medieval', 'early modern European', 'European peoples'] What do you know about the entities? ['Pausa is a/an unknown.', 'Sons of noah is a/an person.', 'Curse of ham is a/an unknown.', 'Medieval is a/an time.', 'Early modern european is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['part of', 'characters', 'located in or next to body of water'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Book of Genesis', 'Characters', 'Japheth'], ['sons of Noah', 'Part of', 'Book of Genesis'], ['Anatolia', 'part of', 'curse of Ham'], ['Anatolia', 'part of', 'Anatolia'], ['Anatolia', 'Located in or next to body of water', 'Aegean Sea']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Anatolia', 'part of', 'curse of Ham'], ['Anatolia', 'part of', 'Anatolia']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - part of - does not hold between Anatolia and curse of Ham.', 'The relation - part of - does not hold between Anatolia and Anatolia.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['sons of Noah', 'Part of', 'Book of Genesis'], ['Book of Genesis', 'Characters', 'Japheth'], ['Anatolia', 'Located in or next to body of water', 'Aegean Sea']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: The name \"Samaria\" is derived from the ancient city of Samaria, the second capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The name likely began being used for the entire kingdom not long after the town of Samaria had become Israel's capital, but it is first documented after its conquest by Sargon II of Assyria, who turned the kingdom into the province of Samerina.

The group comprises Melanie Brown, also known as Mel B (\"Scary Spice\"), Melanie Chisholm, or Mel C (\"Sporty Spice\"), Emma Bunton (\"Baby Spice\"), Geri Halliwell (\"Ginger Spice\"), and Victoria Beckham (\"Posh Spice\"). In 1996, \"Top of the Pops\" magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. With their \"girl power\" mantra, the Spice Girls redefined the girl group concept by targeting a young female fanbase instead of a male audience. They led the teen pop resurgence of the 1990s and became pop culture icons of the decade. They are cited as part of the Second British Invasion of the United States and were \"arguably the most recognizable face\" of Cool Britannia, the mid-1990s celebration of youth culture in the United Kingdom.

Text: The Spice Girls were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \"Wannabe\" in 1996; it hit number one in 37 countries and commenced their global success. Their debut album \"Spice\" (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Their follow-up album, \"Spiceworld\" (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 14 million copies worldwide. Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and consistent lyrical theme of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the five members. In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, \"Forever\", was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting. Since then, the group have reunited for two concert tours, the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019), both of which won the \"Billboard\" Live Music Award for the highest-grossing engagements of their respective years.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (Czech and Slovak: \"Komunistická strana Československa\", KSČ) was a Communist and Marxist–Leninist political party in Czechoslovakia that existed between 1921 and 1992. It was a member of the Comintern. Between 1929 and 1953, it was led by Klement Gottwald. The KSČ was the sole governing party in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic though it was a leading party alongside with the Slovak branch and four other legally permitted non-communist parties. After its election victory in 1946, it seized power in the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état and established a one-party state allied with the Soviet Union. Nationalization of virtually all private enterprises followed. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Communist Party of Czechoslovakia', 'Czech', 'Slovak', 'Communist', 'Marxist–Leninist', 'Czechoslovakia', '1921', '1992', 'Comintern', '1929', '1953', 'Klement Gottwald', 'governing party', 'Czechoslovak Socialist Republic', 'Slovak branch', 'four other legally permitted non-communist parties', '1946', \"1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état\", '1948', 'one-party state', 'Soviet Union', 'Nationalization'] What do you know about the entities?

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Klement Gottwald', 'country', '1992'], ['1946', 'instance of', 'Communist']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - country - does not hold between Klement Gottwald and 1992.', 'The relation - instance of - does not hold between 1946 and Communist.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Communist Party of Czechoslovakia', 'Country', 'Czechoslovakia'], ['Communist Party of Czechoslovakia', 'Member of', 'Comintern'], ['Marxist–Leninist', 'Instance of', 'Communist']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

Text: The Communist Party of China (CPC), commonly known as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), is the founding and sole governing political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CCP leads eight other legally permitted subordinate minor parties together as the United Front. The CCP was founded in 1921, mainly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, with the help of the Far Eastern Bureau of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Far Eastern Secretariat of the Communist International. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the Kuomintang (KMT)'s Nationalist Government from mainland China to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War, leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949. It controls the country's armed forces, the People's Liberation Army (PLA). It is also one of the two major historical contemporary parties in Chinese history, the other being the Kuomintang.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Dana Elaine Owens (born March 18, 1970), known professionally as Queen Latifah, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, actress, and producer. Born in Newark, New Jersey, she signed with Tommy Boy Records in 1989 and released her debut album \"All Hail the Queen\" on November 28, 1989, featuring the hit single \"Ladies First\". \"Nature of a Sista'\" (1991) was her second and final album with Tommy Boy Records.

Her 1984 multi-platinum album, \"Private Dancer\" contained her hit song \"What's Love Got to Do with It\", which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, and it became her first and only No.1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. At age 44, she was the oldest female solo artist to top the Hot 100. Her chart success continued with \"Better Be Good to Me\", \"Private Dancer\", \"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\", \"Typical Male\", \"The Best\", \"I Don't Wanna Fight\", and \"GoldenEye\". During her Break Every Rule World Tour in 1988, she set a then-Guinness World Record for the largest paying audience (180,000) for a solo performer. Turner also acted in the films \"Tommy\" (1975), \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" (1985), and \"Last Action Hero\" (1993). In 1993, \"What's Love Got to Do with It\", a biopic adapted from her autobiography \"I, Tina: My Life Story\", was released. In 2009, Turner retired after completing her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour, which is one of the highest-grossing tours of all time. Your answer: ",

Kim is aided by her clumsy best friend and eventual love interest, Ron Stoppable, his pet naked mole rat Rufus, and ten year-old computer genius Wade.

[['Live Aid', 'Participant', 'Dire Straits'], ['Best British Group', 'participant', 'July 1985'], ['Grammy Award', 'participant', '2018']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Best British Group', 'participant', 'July 1985'], ['Grammy Award', 'participant', '2018']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - participant - does not hold between Best British Group and July 1985.', 'The relation - participant - does not hold between Grammy Award and 2018.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Live Aid', 'Participant', 'Dire Straits']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 self-titled album, \"Fleetwood Mac\", reached No. 1 in the United States. \"Rumours\" (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in various countries around the world and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. \"Rumours\" has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. The band went through personal turmoil while recording the album, as all of the romantic partnerships in the band (John and Christine McVie, Buckingham and Nicks, and Fleetwood and his wife Jenny) separated while continuing to write and record music together.

It lasted until 1947, when it was partitioned into two sovereign dominion states: the Dominion of India (later the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the eastern part of which, still later, became the People's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971). At the inception of the Raj in 1858, Lower Burma was already a part of British India; Upper Burma was added in 1886, and the resulting union, Burma (Myanmar), was administered as an autonomous province until 1937, when it became a separate British colony, gaining its own independence in 1948.

Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3, 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918, and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Administratively, the Eastern Borderlands territory was composed of Lwów, Nowogródek, Polesie, Stanisławów, Tarnopol, Wilno, Wołyń, and Białystok voivodeships (provinces). Today, all these regions are divided between Western Ukraine, Western Belarus, and south-eastern Lithuania, with the major cities of Lviv, Vilnius, and Grodno no longer in Poland. During the Second Polish Republic, Eastern Borderlands denoted the lands beyond the Curzon Line proposed after World War I in December 1919 by the British Foreign Office as the eastern border of the re-emerging sovereign Polish Republic, after over a century of partitions. In September 1939, after the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany simultaneously invaded Poland under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, all the territories were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet republics of Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania, often by means of terror. Let's extract the entities first.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['invaded Poland', 'country', 'Western Belarus'], ['Stanisławów', 'participant', 'Grodno']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - country - does not hold between invaded Poland and Western Belarus.', 'The relation - participant - does not hold between Stanisławów and Grodno.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact', 'Participant', 'Soviet Union'], ['Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact', 'participant', 'Nazi Germany'], ['Ukraine', 'Country', 'Soviet Union'], ['Belarus', 'country', 'Soviet Union'], ['Lithuania', 'Location', 'Soviet Union']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: The Panzer IV was partially succeeded by the Panther medium tank, which was introduced to counter the Soviet T-34, although it continued to be a significant component of German armoured formations to the end of the war. It was the most widely exported tank in German service, with around 300 sold to Finland, Romania, Spain and Bulgaria.

Let's use an example:\nText: Windows Server 2012, codenamed \"Windows Server 8\", is the sixth version of the Windows Server operating system by Microsoft, as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems. It is the server version of Windows based on Windows 8 and succeeds Windows Server 2008 R2, which is derived from the Windows 7 codebase, released nearly three years earlier. Two pre-release versions, a developer preview and a beta version, were released during development. The software was generally available to customers starting on September 4, 2012, by Microsoft. A successor was released on October 18, 2013, entitled Windows Server 2012 R2. Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows Server 2012 on October 9, 2018, and extended support will end on October 10, 2023. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Windows Server 2012', '2012', '8', 'Windows Server', 'operating system', 'Windows NT', 'server', 'Windows 8', 'Windows Server 2008 R2', '2008', '2', 'Windows 7', '7', 'developer preview', 'beta version', 'generally available', 'September 4, 2012', 'Microsoft', 'October 18, 2013', 'Windows Server 2012 R2', 'October 9, 2018', 'October 10, 2023'] What do you know about the entities?

Let's use an example:\nText: \"Bluebeard\" (, ) is a French folktale, the most famous surviving version of which was written by Charles Perrault and first published by Barbin in Paris in 1697 in \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\". The tale tells the story of a wealthy man in the habit of murdering his wives and the attempts of one wife to avoid the fate of her predecessors. \"The White Dove\", \"The Robber Bridegroom\" and \"Fitcher's Bird\" (also called \"Fowler's Fowl\") are tales similar to \"Bluebeard\". The notoriety of the tale is such that Merriam-Webster gives the word \"Bluebeard\" the definition of \"a man who marries and kills one wife after another,\" and the verb \"bluebearding\" has even appeared as a way to describe the crime of either killing a series of women, or seducing and abandoning a series of women. Let's extract the entities first.

Text: The Convair 880 is an American narrow-body jet airliner produced by the Convair division of General Dynamics. It was designed to compete with the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 by being smaller but faster, a niche that failed to create demand. When it was first introduced, some aviation circles claimed that at , it was the fastest jet transport in the world. Only 65 Convair 880s were produced over the lifetime of the production run from 1959 to 1962, and General Dynamics eventually withdrew from the airliner market after considering the 880 project a failure. The Convair 990 was a stretched and faster variant of the 880. Your answer: ",

'Was' is often used to describe a past state, but in these cases, it is not clear what state is being described. For example, 'the fastest jet transport in the world' is not a state, but rather a characteristic. Similarly, 'produced' is not a suitable predicate for describing the Convair 880, as it is the subject that is being produced, not the other way around. Therefore, the correct triples are: [['General Dynamics', 'produced', 'Convair 880'], ['Convair 880', 'competed with', 'Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8'], ['General Dynamics', 'withdrew from', 'airliner market'], ['General Dynamics', 'considered', 'Convair 880 project a failure'], ['Convair 990', 'was', 'a stretched and faster variant of the 880']] \nFinal Answer: The final answer is [['General Dynamics', 'produced', 'Convair 880'], ['Convair 880', 'competed with', 'Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8'], ['General Dynamics', 'withdrew from', 'airliner market'], ['General Dynamics', 'considered', 'Convair 880 project a failure'], ['Convair 990', 'was', 'a stretched and faster variant of the 880']].

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Pennsylvania is the 33rd-largest state by area, and the 5th-most populous state with a total population of 13,011,844 according to the most recent official U.S. Census count in 2020. It is the 9th-most densely populated of the 50 states. Pennsylvania's two most populous cities are Philadelphia (1,580,863), and Pittsburgh (302,407). The state capital and its 13th-largest city is Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has of waterfront along Lake Erie and the Delaware River. Let's extract the entities first.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Lake Erie', 'capital', '2020'], ['Delaware River', 'located in or next to body of water', '13']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - capital - does not hold between Lake Erie and 2020.', 'The relation - located in or next to body of water - does not hold between Delaware River and 13.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Pennsylvania', 'Capital', 'Harrisburg'], ['Pennsylvania', 'Located in or next to body of water', 'Lake Erie'], ['Pennsylvania', 'located in or next to body of water', 'Delaware River']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: William Penn (14 October 1644 – 30 July 1718) was an English writer and religious thinker belonging to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, a North American colony of England. He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed. Philadelphia was planned out to be grid-like with its streets and be very easy to navigate, unlike London where Penn was from. The streets are named with numbers and tree names. He chose to use the names of trees for the cross streets because Pennsylvania means \"Penn's Woods\". Your answer: ",

It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated.

The state is divided into three counties, having the lowest number of any state; from north to south, they are New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County.

Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: In 1681, King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn's father, the admiral and politician Sir William Penn. This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil, sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, (past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies) in New Castle (now in Delaware) in 1682. On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor, and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held. Afterward, Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia, on the west bank. However, Penn's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch, Swedish colonists, and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware, but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland's proprietor family, the Calverts and Lord Baltimore. These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a \"Pennsylvania\", so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly. Twenty-three years later in 1704, they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware, were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential settlement in the new colony, New Castle, the original Swedish colony town became the capital. Your answer: ",

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Adobe InDesign is a desktop publishing and typesetting software application produced by Adobe Inc.. It can be used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and ebooks. InDesign can also publish content suitable for tablet devices in conjunction with Adobe Digital Publishing Suite. Graphic designers and production artists are the principal users, creating and laying out periodical publications, posters, and print media. It also supports export to EPUB and SWF formats to create e-books and digital publications, including digital magazines, and content suitable for consumption on tablet computers. In addition, InDesign supports XML, style sheets, and other coding markup, making it suitable for exporting tagged text content for use in other digital and online formats.

It has also made inroads with film and television editors who have traditionally used Avid Technology's Media Composer. According to a 2007 SCRI study, Final Cut Pro made up 49% of the United States professional editing market, with Avid at 22%.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Copa América (CONMEBOL America Cup), known until 1975 as the South American Football Championship (Campeonato Sudamericano de Fútbol in Spanish and Copa Sul-Americana de Futebol in Portuguese), is the main men's football tournament contested among national teams from South America. It is the oldest still-running international football competition, as well as the third most watched in the world. The competition determines the champions of South America. Since the 1990s, teams from North America and Asia have also been invited to compete. Let's extract the entities first.

Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley. The band has released eight studio albums and two live performance albums. Their eighth studio album, \"Atonement\", was released on August 16, 2019. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Killswitch Engage', 'metalcore', 'Westfield, Massachusetts', '1999', 'Overcast', 'Aftershock', 'Jesse Leach', 'Joel Stroetzel', 'Adam Dutkiewicz', \"Mike D'Antonio\", 'Justin Foley', 'studio album', 'live performance albums', 'Atonement', 'August 16, 2019'] What do you know about the entities? ['Metalcore is a/an concept.', '1999 is a/an date.', 'Studio album is a/an unknown.', 'Live performance albums is a/an unknown.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['genre', 'member of'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['studio album', 'member of', 'metalcore'], [\"Mike D'Antonio\", 'member of', 'August 16, 2019'], ['Joel Stroetzel', 'member of', 'Killswitch Engage'], ['Jesse Leach', 'Member of', 'Killswitch Engage'], ['Killswitch Engage', 'Genre', 'metalcore'], ['Overcast', 'genre', 'metalcore'], ['Adam Dutkiewicz', 'member of', 'Killswitch Engage']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['studio album', 'member of', 'metalcore'], [\"Mike D'Antonio\", 'member of', 'August 16, 2019']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - member of - does not hold between studio album and metalcore.', \"The relation - member of - does not hold between Mike D'Antonio and August 16, 2019.\"] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Killswitch Engage', 'Genre', 'metalcore'], ['Overcast', 'genre', 'metalcore'], ['Jesse Leach', 'Member of', 'Killswitch Engage'], ['Joel Stroetzel', 'member of', 'Killswitch Engage'], ['Adam Dutkiewicz', 'member of', 'Killswitch Engage']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Arms of Morpheus is the third studio album by the Dutch progressive metal band Kingfisher Sky. The album was originally released on the 24th of October, 2014 and peaked at #31 on the Netherlands album charts the week after its release. The funding for the album was obtained via an online crowdfunding campaign, which successfully raised enough money to get the album released. Your answer: ",

Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the \"defensive\" team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Your answer: ",

It is based on the French science fiction comics series \"Valérian and Laureline\", written by Pierre Christin and illustrated by Jean-Claude Mézières.

Semantically, they often have emotive or interpersonal meanings, and their use is sometimes called exclamatory Morphologically, they are usually simple and do not inflect. Your answer: ",

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Washington and Lee was originally a small classical school. It was founded as the Augusta Academy (later renamed Liberty Hall Academy) by Scots-Irish Presbyterian pioneers, though the university has never claimed any sectarian affiliation. In 1796, shortly before the end of his second term as U.S. President, George Washington endowed the struggling academy with a gift of stock, one of the largest gifts to an educational institution at that time. In gratitude, the school was renamed for Washington, the commander of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, president at the 1787 Federal Constitutional Convention, and first President of the United States. In 1865, shortly after his April 9 surrender to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Armies, former Confederate States Army general-in-chief Robert E. Lee (1807–1870) served as president of the college for five years until his death in 1870, when the college was thereafter renamed the \"Washington and Lee University.\" One of the oldest institutions of higher education in the American South, W&L is the second-oldest in the Commonwealth of Virginia (next to the College of William & Mary, founded in 1693). Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Scots-Irish', 'Presbyterian', '1796', 'George Washington', 'Continental Army', 'American Revolutionary War', '1787', 'Constitutional Convention', 'President of the United States', '1865', '9', 'Ulysses S. Grant', 'Union Armies', 'Confederate States Army', 'Robert E. Lee', '1807', '1870', 'Washington and Lee University', 'American South', 'Virginia', 'College of William & Mary', '1693'] What do you know about the entities? ['1796 is a/an date.', '1787 is a/an date.', '1865 is a/an date.', '9 is a/an number.', '1807 is a/an number.', '1870 is a/an number.', '1693 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['named after', 'inception'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['College of William & Mary', 'Inception', '1693'], ['Continental Army', 'inception', 'American Revolutionary War'], ['Washington and Lee University', 'Named after', 'Robert E. Lee'], ['1870', 'inception', 'American Revolutionary War']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['1870', 'inception', 'American Revolutionary War'], ['Continental Army', 'inception', 'American Revolutionary War']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - inception - does not hold between 1870 and American Revolutionary War.', 'The relation - inception - does not hold between Continental Army and American Revolutionary War.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Washington and Lee University', 'Named after', 'Robert E. Lee'], ['College of William & Mary', 'Inception', '1693']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: David E.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Pittodrie Stadium, commonly referred to as Pittodrie, is an all-seater stadium in Aberdeen, Scotland. Used primarily for football, it has been the home ground of the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) club Aberdeen F.C. since they were formed in 1903. Prior to then, the ground hosted the original Aberdeen F.C. from 1899 until the merger that created the present club. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Pittodrie Stadium', 'all-seater stadium', 'Aberdeen', 'football', 'Scottish Professional Football League', 'Aberdeen F.C.', '1903', 'original Aberdeen F.C.', '1899'] What do you know about the entities? ['All-seater stadium is a/an location.', 'Football is a/an concept.', '1903 is a/an date.', 'Original aberdeen f.c. is a/an media.', '1899 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['location', 'sport'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['1899', 'sport', 'Aberdeen F.C.'], ['Pittodrie Stadium', 'Location', 'Aberdeen'], ['Aberdeen', 'sport', '1899'], ['Aberdeen F.C.', 'sport', 'football'], ['Pittodrie Stadium', 'Sport', 'football'], ['Scottish Professional Football League', 'sport', 'football']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['1899', 'sport', 'Aberdeen F.C.'], ['Aberdeen', 'sport', '1899']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - sport - does not hold between 1899 and Aberdeen F.C..', 'The relation - sport - does not hold between Aberdeen and 1899.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Pittodrie Stadium', 'Location', 'Aberdeen'], ['Pittodrie Stadium', 'Sport', 'football'], ['Scottish Professional Football League', 'sport', 'football'], ['Aberdeen F.C.', 'sport', 'football']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

Instead, 'rugby union player' is a profession or role that Arthur Browning held, so the correct triple would be:\n\n[['Arthur Browning', 'Occupation', 'rugby union player']]\n\nTherefore, the final triples are:\n\n[['Arthur Browning', 'Birthdate', '2 July 1897'], ['Arthur Browning', 'Deathdate', '10 December 1962'], ['Arthur Browning','sport', 'rugby union'], ['Arthur Browning', 'Nationality', 'Scotland'], ['Arthur Browning', 'Occupation', 'rugby union player']]",

Therefore, the correct triple should be [['Brock Vandagriff', 'is a member of', 'Georgia Bulldogs']].\n\nThe triple [['quarterback', 'is a', 'American football']] seems to be incorrect. Quarterback is a position in American football, not a type of American football. Therefore, the correct triple should be [['quarterback', 'is a position in', 'American football']].\n\nThe final triples are: [['Brock Vandagriff', 'is a member of', 'Georgia Bulldogs'], ['Brock Vandagriff', 'is a', 'quarterback'], ['quarterback', 'is a position in', 'American football']]\n\nThese triples represent the following knowledge: Brock Vandagriff is a member of the Georgia Bulldogs team, he is a quarterback, and quarterback is a position in American football. \n\nNote: The text does not provide information about the nationality of Brock Vandagriff, so the triple [['Brock Vandagriff', 'is a', 'American']] is not supported by the text. Similarly, the text does not provide information about the type of football played by the Georgia Bulldogs, so the triple [['Georgia Bulldogs', 'plays', 'American football']] is not supported by the text.

Pu Songling, a well-known writer of the Qing Dynasty, is one of the most famous people from Zibo. As the birthplace of Qi culture, Zibo is a notable tourist city. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Zibo', 'State of Qi', 'Linzi', 'Pu Songling', 'Qing Dynasty'] What do you know about the entities? [] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['capital', 'location'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['State of Qi', 'Capital', 'Linzi'], ['Linzi', 'Location', 'Zibo'], ['Zibo', 'location', 'Qing Dynasty'], ['Zibo', 'location', 'Linzi']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Zibo', 'location', 'Linzi'], ['Zibo', 'location', 'Qing Dynasty']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - location - does not hold between Zibo and Linzi.', 'The relation - location - does not hold between Zibo and Qing Dynasty.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['State of Qi', 'Capital', 'Linzi'], ['Linzi', 'Location', 'Zibo']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre. The scene declined in the second half of the 1990s but subsequently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Obituary, and Death collectively sold over five-million albums. Your answer: ",

The Bears compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. The Bears have won nine NFL Championships, including one Super Bowl, and hold the NFL record for the most enshrinees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the most retired jersey numbers.

The band's fifth album, \"Living Things\" (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, \"The Hunting Party\" (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, \"One More Light\" (2017), was their first pop-oriented record.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The narrative takes as its literal subject the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward, and describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven. Allegorically the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (\"Inferno\"), followed by the penitent Christian life (\"Purgatorio\"), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (\"Paradiso\"). Dante draws on medieval Roman Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the \"Summa Theologica\" of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the \"Divine Comedy\" has been called \"the \"Summa\" in verse\". In Dante's work, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil (who represents human reason), Beatrice (who represents divine revelation, theology, faith, and grace), and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother). Erich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues; this along with the fully imagined world of the \"Divine Comedy\", different from our own but fully visualized, suggests that the \"Divine Comedy\" could be said to have inaugurated realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Hell', 'Purgatory', 'Heaven', 'Allegorically', 'Roman Catholic', 'Thomistic philosophy', 'Summa Theologica', 'Thomas Aquinas', 'Divine Comedy', 'Virgil', 'human reason', 'Beatrice', 'divine revelation', 'theology', 'faith', 'grace', 'Saint', 'Bernard of Clairvaux', 'contemplative mysticism', 'devotion to Mary the Mother', 'Erich Auerbach'] What do you know about the entities?

[['contemplative mysticism', 'author', 'faith'], ['Thomistic philosophy', 'Founded by', 'Thomas Aquinas'], ['Divine Comedy', 'characters', 'Bernard of Clairvaux'], ['Thomas Aquinas', 'Notable work', 'Summa Theologica'], ['Divine Comedy', 'characters', 'Virgil'], ['Summa Theologica', 'Author', 'Thomas Aquinas'], ['Divine Comedy', 'Characters', 'Thomas Aquinas'], ['Virgil', 'author', 'devotion to Mary the Mother'], ['Divine Comedy', 'characters', 'Beatrice']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Virgil', 'author', 'devotion to Mary the Mother'], ['contemplative mysticism', 'author', 'faith']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - author - does not hold between Virgil and devotion to Mary the Mother.', 'The relation - author - does not hold between contemplative mysticism and faith.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Thomistic philosophy', 'Founded by', 'Thomas Aquinas'], ['Summa Theologica', 'Author', 'Thomas Aquinas'], ['Thomas Aquinas', 'Notable work', 'Summa Theologica'], ['Divine Comedy', 'Characters', 'Thomas Aquinas'], ['Divine Comedy', 'characters', 'Virgil'], ['Divine Comedy', 'characters', 'Beatrice'], ['Divine Comedy', 'characters', 'Bernard of Clairvaux']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The fruit is hard, firm and with a light green skin and crisp, juicy flesh. The flavour is tart and acidic. It remains firm when baked, making it a very popular cooking apple used in pies, where it can be sweetened. The apple goes from being completely green to turning yellow when overripe.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['2019', 'instance of', 'cooking apple'], ['cooking apple', 'instance of', 'Granny Smith']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - instance of - does not hold between 2019 and cooking apple.', 'The relation - instance of - does not hold between cooking apple and Granny Smith.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Granny Smith', 'Instance of', 'cooking apple']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Chevrolet ( ), colloquially referred to as Chevy and formally the Chevrolet Division of General Motors Company, is an American automobile division of the American manufacturer General Motors (GM). Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3, 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918, and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Chevrolet', 'American automobile', 'General Motors', 'Louis Chevrolet', 'William C. Durant', 'November 3, 1911', 'reverse merger', 'May 2, 1918', '1919', 'Alfred Sloan', 'maxim', 'Henry Ford', 'Model T', 'Ford', 'United States', '1929', 'Chevrolet International'] What do you know about the entities? ['Reverse merger is a/an concept.', '1919 is a/an date.', 'Maxim is a/an concept.', '1929 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['owned by', 'founded by', 'inception', 'manufacturer', 'country'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Model T', 'Manufacturer', 'Ford'], ['Chevrolet', 'Inception', 'November 3, 1911'], ['Ford', 'Country', 'United States'], ['Chevrolet', 'founded by', 'William C. Durant'], ['Henry Ford', 'inception', 'Alfred Sloan'], ['Chevrolet', 'Owned by', 'General Motors'], ['Chevrolet', 'Founded by', 'Louis Chevrolet'], ['1929', 'country', 'Louis Chevrolet']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Henry Ford', 'inception', 'Alfred Sloan'], ['1929', 'country', 'Louis Chevrolet']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - inception - does not hold between Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan.', 'The relation - country - does not hold between 1929 and Louis Chevrolet.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Chevrolet', 'Owned by', 'General Motors'], ['Chevrolet', 'Founded by', 'Louis Chevrolet'], ['Chevrolet', 'founded by', 'William C. Durant'], ['Chevrolet', 'Inception', 'November 3, 1911'], ['Model T', 'Manufacturer', 'Ford'], ['Ford', 'Country', 'United States']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: The Toyota iQ is a transverse engined, front-wheel-drive city car that was manufactured by Toyota and marketed in a single generation for Japan (2008–2016); Europe (2008–2015); and North America (2012–2015), where it was marketed as the Scion iQ.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer). The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Ancient Egypt', 'civilization', 'ancient', 'North Africa', 'Nile River', 'Egypt', 'prehistoric Egypt', '3100', 'BC', 'conventional Egyptian chronology', 'Upper and Lower Egypt', 'Menes', 'Narmer', 'history of ancient Egypt', 'Old Kingdom', 'Early Bronze Age', 'Middle Kingdom', 'Middle Bronze Age', 'New Kingdom', 'Late Bronze Age'] What do you know about the entities? ['Civilization is a/an concept.', 'Ancient is a/an concept.', 'Prehistoric egypt is a/an time.', '3100 is a/an date.', 'Conventional egyptian chronology is a/an unknown.', 'History of ancient egypt is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['country', 'part of', 'located in or next to body of water', 'follows', 'country of citizenship'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Menes', 'Country of citizenship', 'Ancient Egypt'], ['Nile River', 'Country', 'Egypt'], ['New Kingdom', 'part of', 'BC'], ['Middle Kingdom', 'part of', 'history of ancient Egypt'], ['New Kingdom', 'part of', 'history of ancient Egypt'], ['Egypt', 'Located in or next to body of water', 'Nile River'], ['Egypt', 'Part of', 'North Africa'], ['Old Kingdom', 'part of', 'history of ancient Egypt'], ['Old Kingdom', 'country', '3100'], ['Ancient Egypt', 'Follows', 'prehistoric Egypt']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['New Kingdom', 'part of', 'BC'], ['Old Kingdom', 'country', '3100']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - part of - does not hold between New Kingdom and BC.', 'The relation - country - does not hold between Old Kingdom and 3100.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Nile River', 'Country', 'Egypt'], ['Egypt', 'Part of', 'North Africa'], ['Egypt', 'Located in or next to body of water', 'Nile River'], ['Ancient Egypt', 'Follows', 'prehistoric Egypt'], ['Menes', 'Country of citizenship', 'Ancient Egypt'], ['Old Kingdom', 'part of', 'history of ancient Egypt'], ['Middle Kingdom', 'part of', 'history of ancient Egypt'], ['New Kingdom', 'part of', 'history of ancient Egypt']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: KV4 is a tomb in the Valley of the Kings (Egypt). The tomb was initiated for the burial of Ramesses XI but it is likely that its construction was abandoned and that it was never used for Ramesses's interment. It also seems likely that Pinedjem I intended to usurp this tomb for his own burial, but that he too abandoned the plan. KV4 is notable for being the last royal tomb that was quarried in the Valley and because it has been interpreted as being a workshop used during the official dismantling of the royal necropolis in the early Third Intermediate Period.

The magazine features news on developments in the video game industry, previews of new games, and reviews of the latest popular PC games, along with other features relating to hardware, mods, \"classic\" games and various other topics. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['PC Gamer', 'magazine', '1993', 'PC gaming', 'Future plc', 'video game industry', 'mod'] What do you know about the entities? ['Magazine is a/an concept.', '1993 is a/an date.', 'Video game industry is a/an concept.', 'Mod is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['instance of', 'owned by'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['PC Gamer', 'Instance of', 'magazine'], ['video game industry', 'instance of', 'magazine'], ['PC Gamer', 'owned by', 'Future plc'], ['PC Gamer', 'Owned by', 'Future plc']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['video game industry', 'instance of', 'magazine'], ['PC Gamer', 'owned by', 'Future plc']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - instance of - does not hold between video game industry and magazine.', 'The relation - owned by - does not hold between PC Gamer and Future plc.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['PC Gamer', 'Instance of', 'magazine'], ['PC Gamer', 'Owned by', 'Future plc']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Santa Monica Studio is an American video game developer based in Los Angeles. A first-party studio for Sony Interactive Entertainment, it is best known for developing the \"God of War\" series.

Starring Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, and Dax Shepard, it follows an American soldier who takes part in a classified hibernation experiment, only to be accidentally frozen for too long and awaken 500 years later in a dystopian world where dysgenics and commercialism have run rampant, mankind has embraced anti-intellectualism, and society is devoid of such traits as intellectual curiosity, social responsibility, justice, and human rights. The film was not screened for critics, and the distributor, 20th Century Fox, was accused of abandoning it.

Klum and the designers' mentor Tim Gunn both left the show in 2018 in order to helm another fashion competition show, \"Making the Cut\" on Amazon Video. American model Karlie Kloss followed Klum as the new host, with Season 4 winner Christian Siriano replacing Gunn as mentor. Your answer: ",
        "generated_text": " Please provide your answer in the format of triples. \nYour task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Kim Possible is an American animated action comedy-adventure television series created by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle for Disney Channel. The title character is a teenage girl tasked with fighting crime on a regular basis while coping with everyday issues commonly associated with adolescence. Kim is aided by her clumsy best friend and eventual love interest, Ron Stoppable, his pet naked mole rat Rufus, and ten year-old computer genius Wade. Known collectively as Team Possible, Kim and Ron's missions primarily require them to thwart the evil plans of the mad scientist–supervillain duo Dr. Drakken and his sidekick Shego.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Wade', 'characters', 'Rufus'], ['Shego', 'genre', 'Kim Possible']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - characters - does not hold between Wade and Rufus.', 'The relation - genre - does not hold between Shego and Kim Possible.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Kim Possible', 'Genre', 'adventure'], ['Kim Possible', 'Characters', 'title character']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

He then earned a master's degree in computer science at Purdue University while also working full-time for the U.S. Department of the Navy. In 1977, he joined the Pillsbury Company where he later became vice president. During the 1980s, Cain's success as a business executive at Burger King prompted Pillsbury to appoint him as chairman and CEO of Godfather's Pizza, in which capacity he served from 1986 to 1996.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (Czech and Slovak: \"Komunistická strana Československa\", KSČ) was a Communist and Marxist–Leninist political party in Czechoslovakia that existed between 1921 and 1992. It was a member of the Comintern. Between 1929 and 1953, it was led by Klement Gottwald. The KSČ was the sole governing party in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic though it was a leading party alongside with the Slovak branch and four other legally permitted non-communist parties. After its election victory in 1946, it seized power in the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état and established a one-party state allied with the Soviet Union. Nationalization of virtually all private enterprises followed. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Communist Party of Czechoslovakia', 'Czech', 'Slovak', 'Communist', 'Marxist–Leninist', 'Czechoslovakia', '1921', '1992', 'Comintern', '1929', '1953', 'Klement Gottwald', 'governing party', 'Czechoslovak Socialist Republic', 'Slovak branch', 'four other legally permitted non-communist parties', '1946', \"1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état\", '1948', 'one-party state', 'Soviet Union', 'Nationalization'] What do you know about the entities?

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Chevrolet ( ), colloquially referred to as Chevy and formally the Chevrolet Division of General Motors Company, is an American automobile division of the American manufacturer General Motors (GM). Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3, 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918, and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Chevrolet', 'American automobile', 'General Motors', 'Louis Chevrolet', 'William C. Durant', 'November 3, 1911', 'reverse merger', 'May 2, 1918', '1919', 'Alfred Sloan', 'maxim', 'Henry Ford', 'Model T', 'Ford', 'United States', '1929', 'Chevrolet International'] What do you know about the entities? ['Reverse merger is a/an concept.', '1919 is a/an date.', 'Maxim is a/an concept.', '1929 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['owned by', 'founded by', 'inception', 'manufacturer', 'country'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Model T', 'Manufacturer', 'Ford'], ['Chevrolet', 'Inception', 'November 3, 1911'], ['Ford', 'Country', 'United States'], ['Chevrolet', 'founded by', 'William C. Durant'], ['Henry Ford', 'inception', 'Alfred Sloan'], ['Chevrolet', 'Owned by', 'General Motors'], ['Chevrolet', 'Founded by', 'Louis Chevrolet'], ['1929', 'country', 'Louis Chevrolet']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Henry Ford', 'inception', 'Alfred Sloan'], ['1929', 'country', 'Louis Chevrolet']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - inception - does not hold between Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan.', 'The relation - country - does not hold between 1929 and Louis Chevrolet.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Chevrolet', 'Owned by', 'General Motors'], ['Chevrolet', 'Founded by', 'Louis Chevrolet'], ['Chevrolet', 'founded by', 'William C. Durant'], ['Chevrolet', 'Inception', 'November 3, 1911'], ['Model T', 'Manufacturer', 'Ford'], ['Ford', 'Country', 'United States']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: The Peugeot 408 is a small family car produced by Peugeot.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: East Rutherford is the home of the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which includes Meadowlands Arena and MetLife Stadium, and was previously the location of Giants Stadium. The arena is best known as the former home of the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association and the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League, and also hosted college basketball, arena football, concerts, and other events. MetLife Stadium is home of the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL), the New York Guardians of the XFL, and hosted Super Bowl XLVIII, which made East Rutherford the smallest city ever to host a Super Bowl. Giants Stadium, which hosted the Giants and Jets until 2009, was also the original home of the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer.

Let's use an example:\nText: For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region, and the Ottoman Empire's third-largest after Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Cairo. The city's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia. When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline. At the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul. In the 1940s it lost its main access to the sea, Antakya and İskenderun, also to Turkey. The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation. This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. It won the title of the \"Islamic Capital of Culture 2006\", and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks. The Battle of Aleppo (2012–2016) occurred in the city during the Syrian Civil War, and many parts of the city suffered massive destruction.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The Offspring is often credited—alongside fellow California punk bands Green Day and Rancid—for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the 1990s. They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021). Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['The Offspring', 'California punk', 'Green Day', 'Rancid', '1990', '40', '1989', 'self-titled', 'Baghdad', '1991', 'Epitaph Records', 'Ignition', '1992', 'Smash', '1994', 'Come Out and Play', 'independent record label', 'Columbia Records', '1996', 'Ixnay on the Hombre', '1997', 'gold and platinum', 'Americana', '1998', 'MTV', 'Conspiracy of One', '2000', 'Splinter', '2003', 'Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace', '2008', 'Days Go By', '2012', 'Let the Bad Times Roll', '2021'] What do you know about the entities? ['1990 is a/an date.', '40 is a/an number.', '1989 is a/an date.', 'Self-titled is a/an media.', '1991 is a/an number.', '1992 is a/an number.', '1994 is a/an number.', 'Independent record label is a/an organization.', '1996 is a/an date.', '1997 is a/an number.', 'Gold and platinum is a/an organization.', '1998 is a/an number.', '2000 is a/an number.', '2003 is a/an number.', '2008 is a/an number.', '2012 is a/an number.', '2021 is a/an number.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['follows'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Days Go By', 'follows', 'Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace'], ['1991', 'follows', '1989'], ['40', 'follows', 'Smash'], ['Smash', 'Follows', 'Ignition'], ['Splinter', 'follows', 'Conspiracy of One'], ['Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace', 'follows', 'Splinter']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['1991', 'follows', '1989'], ['40', 'follows', 'Smash']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - follows - does not hold between 1991 and 1989.', 'The relation - follows - does not hold between 40 and Smash.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Smash', 'Follows', 'Ignition'], ['Splinter', 'follows', 'Conspiracy of One'], ['Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace', 'follows', 'Splinter'], ['Days Go By', 'follows', 'Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Primarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s, the band have released seven original studio albums: \"Employment\" (2005), \"Yours Truly, Angry Mob\" (2007), \"Off with Their Heads\" (2008), \"The Future Is Medieval\" (2011), \"Education, Education, Education & War\" (2014), \"Stay Together\" (2016), and \"Duck\" (2019), one EP: \"Lap of Honour\" (2005), one compilation album: \"\" (2012) and numerous singles, including the number one hit song \"Ruby\".

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Washington and Lee was originally a small classical school. It was founded as the Augusta Academy (later renamed Liberty Hall Academy) by Scots-Irish Presbyterian pioneers, though the university has never claimed any sectarian affiliation. In 1796, shortly before the end of his second term as U.S. President, George Washington endowed the struggling academy with a gift of stock, one of the largest gifts to an educational institution at that time. In gratitude, the school was renamed for Washington, the commander of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, president at the 1787 Federal Constitutional Convention, and first President of the United States. In 1865, shortly after his April 9 surrender to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Armies, former Confederate States Army general-in-chief Robert E. Lee (1807–1870) served as president of the college for five years until his death in 1870, when the college was thereafter renamed the \"Washington and Lee University.\" One of the oldest institutions of higher education in the American South, W&L is the second-oldest in the Commonwealth of Virginia (next to the College of William & Mary, founded in 1693).

Text: Confederate Ireland was the period of Irish Catholic self-government between 1642 and 1649, during the Eleven Years' War. During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press. Confederate ambassadors were appointed and recognised in France, Spain and the Papal States, who supplied the Confederates with money and weapons. Your answer: ",

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The International Freedom Battalion (; ; ), commonly abbreviated as IFB or EÖT, is an armed group consisting of leftist foreign fighters fighting for the People's Protection Units in the Syrian Civil War in support of the Rojava Revolution and against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the Turkish Armed Forces, and the Syrian National Army. The formation of the IFB was announced in June 2015 in Ras al-Ayn. Inspiration for the group came from the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War. The political ideologies of the fighters include Anarchism, Marxism–Leninism, Hoxhaism, Maoism, and anarcho-communism. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['International Freedom Battalion', 'foreign fighters', \"People's Protection Units\", 'Syrian Civil War', 'Rojava Revolution', 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant', 'Turkish Armed Forces', 'Syrian National Army', 'June 2015', 'Ras al-Ayn', 'International Brigades', 'Spanish Civil War', 'Anarchism', 'Marxism–Leninism', 'Hoxhaism', 'Maoism', 'anarcho-communism'] What do you know about the entities? ['Foreign fighters is a/an unknown.', 'Anarcho-communism is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['part of'] Let's make a draft of the triples.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant', 'part of', 'Rojava Revolution'], ['Ras al-Ayn', 'part of', 'June 2015']].

In the late sixth century BC, the area was subjugated by the Persian Achaemenid Empire, then incorporated into the kingdom of Macedonia in the fourth century BC.

Let's use an example:\nText: The Maccabiah Games (a.k.a. the World Maccabiah Games; , or משחקי המכביה העולמית; often referred to as the \"Jewish Olympics\"), first held in 1932, are an international Jewish and Israeli multi-sport event now held quadrennially in Israel. It is the third-largest sporting event in the world, with 10,000 athletes competing. The Maccabiah Games were declared a \"Regional Sports Event\" by, and under the auspices and supervision of, the International Olympic Committee in 1961. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Maccabiah Games', '1932', 'Jewish', 'multi-sport event', 'Israel', 'International Olympic Committee', '1961'] What do you know about the entities? ['1932 is a/an date.', 'Multi-sport event is a/an concept.', '1961 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['instance of'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['1932', 'instance of', '1961'], ['International Olympic Committee', 'instance of', 'Israel'], ['Maccabiah Games', 'Instance of', 'multi-sport event']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['International Olympic Committee', 'instance of', 'Israel'], ['1932', 'instance of', '1961']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - instance of - does not hold between International Olympic Committee and Israel.', 'The relation - instance of - does not hold between 1932 and 1961.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Maccabiah Games', 'Instance of', 'multi-sport event']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: The inaugural season was in 2010. It was designed to replace the IAAF Golden League, which had been held annually since 1998. The full sponsorship name is the Wanda Diamond League, the result of an agreement with Wanda Group that was announced in December 2019. Your answer: ",
        "generated_text": "1. ['2010', 'instance of', '1998'] 2. ['IAAF Golden League', 'instance of', 'Wanda Diamond League'] 3. ['Wanda Diamond League', 'instance of', 'Wanda Group'] 4. ['Wanda Diamond League', 'instance of', '2010'] 5. ['Wanda Diamond League', 'instance of', 'December 2019'] \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. ['2010', 'instance of', '1998'] 2. ['Wanda Diamond League', 'instance of', 'Wanda Group']. I hope it is correct. \n\nExplanation: \n\n1. The relation 'instance of' does not hold between '2010' and '1998' because '2010' is a specific year and '1998' is another specific year. They are not instances of each other. \n2. The relation 'instance of' does not hold between 'IAAF Golden League' and 'Wanda Diamond League' because 'IAAF Golden League' is a specific event and 'Wanda Diamond League' is another specific event. They are not instances of each other. \n3. This triple is correct because 'Wanda Diamond League' is an instance of 'Wanda Group', which is a company that sponsors the event. \n4. The relation 'instance of' does not hold between 'Wanda Diamond League' and '2010' because 'Wanda Diamond League' is an event and '2010' is a year. They are not instances of each other. \n5. The relation 'instance of' does not hold between 'Wanda Diamond League' and 'December 2019' because 'Wanda Diamond League' is an event and 'December 2019' is a specific date. They are not instances of each other. \n\nTherefore, the correct triples are 3. ['Wanda Diamond League', 'instance of', 'Wanda Group'].  This triple indicates that the Wanda Diamond League is an event sponsored by Wanda Group.  It does not imply any hierarchical relationship between the events or the years.  It simply indicates that Wanda Group is the sponsor of the Wanda Diamond League.  The other triples are incorrect because they imply hierarchical relationships between the events or the years, which is not supported by the text.  The text only mentions that the Wanda Diamond League replaced the IAAF Golden League, but it does not imply any hierarchical relationship between",

With over 200 million inhabitants, it is the most populous state in India as well as the most populous country subdivision in the world. It was created on 1 April 1937 as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh during British rule, and was renamed \"Uttar Pradesh\" in 1950, giving it the acronym \"UP\". The state is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts, with the state capital being Lucknow, and Allahabad serving as the judicial capital. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand), was carved from the state's Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and Yamuna, join at Triveni Sangam in Allahabad and flow further east as Ganges. Other prominent rivers are Gomti and Saryu. The forest cover in the state is 6.1% of the state's geographical area. The cultivable area is 82% of total geographical area and net area sown is 68.5% of cultivable area.

Shot on location in Washington, DC and at a farm in Maryland, the film features Gone with the Wind actress Leona Roberts as Jane Jones, a 1920s rural housewife tired of a grueling and unglamorous day-to-day life. She takes a vacation to the city where she stays with her sister Hattie, played by Maud Howell Smith.

However, an international forensic test conducted in 2013 rejected allegations that he was poisoned. It was concluded that he was suffering from prostate cancer. Pinochet, backed by elements of the armed forces, denied permission for Neruda's funeral to be made a public event, but thousands of grieving Chileans disobeyed the curfew and crowded the streets. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['September 1973', \"coup d'état\", 'Augusto Pinochet', '23 September 1973', '2015', '2013'] What do you know about the entities?

[['23 September 1973', 'participant', 'Augusto Pinochet'], ['23 September 1973', 'participant', 'Augusto Pinochet'], [\"coup d'état\", 'Participant', 'Augusto Pinochet']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['23 September 1973', 'participant', 'Augusto Pinochet'], ['23 September 1973', 'participant', 'Augusto Pinochet']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - participant - does not hold between 23 September 1973 and Augusto Pinochet.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [[\"coup d'état\", 'Participant', 'Augusto Pinochet']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Don Carlo II di Tocco Cantelmo Stuart (7 March 1756 – 19 July 1823), or Carlo di Tocco for short, was a 18th/19th-century Italian noble, serving as the Prince of Montemiletto and the titular Prince of Achaea, among other titles, from the death of his father Restaino di Tocco Cantelmo Stuart in 1796 to his own death in 1823. In addition to holding various fiefs throughout Italy, Carlo also rose to prominent positions within the Kingdom of Naples and its successor state, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

It is part of the Cascade Range and is set on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The peak is situated north of Mount Daniel, and less than one mile south of Jade Lake. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into East Fork Foss River, which is a tributary of the Skykomish River. The summit saddle has two rock horns, of which the higher southwest peak is the true summit. The first ascent was made August 1950 by Bill and Gene Prater.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: PC Gamer is a magazine and website founded in the United Kingdom in 1993 devoted to PC gaming and published monthly by Future plc. The magazine has several regional editions, with the UK and US editions becoming the best selling PC games magazines in their respective countries. The magazine features news on developments in the video game industry, previews of new games, and reviews of the latest popular PC games, along with other features relating to hardware, mods, \"classic\" games and various other topics.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['video game industry', 'instance of', 'magazine'], ['PC Gamer', 'owned by', 'Future plc']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - instance of - does not hold between video game industry and magazine.', 'The relation - owned by - does not hold between PC Gamer and Future plc.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['PC Gamer', 'Instance of', 'magazine'], ['PC Gamer', 'Owned by', 'Future plc']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: On its release weekend, \"Gears of War 2\" sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Uttar Pradesh (; , 'Northern Province') is a state in northern India. With over 200 million inhabitants, it is the most populous state in India as well as the most populous country subdivision in the world. It was created on 1 April 1937 as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh during British rule, and was renamed \"Uttar Pradesh\" in 1950, giving it the acronym \"UP\". The state is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts, with the state capital being Lucknow, and Allahabad serving as the judicial capital. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand), was carved from the state's Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and Yamuna, join at Triveni Sangam in Allahabad and flow further east as Ganges. Other prominent rivers are Gomti and Saryu. The forest cover in the state is 6.1% of the state's geographical area. The cultivable area is 82% of total geographical area and net area sown is 68.5% of cultivable area. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Uttar Pradesh', 'state', 'northern India', 'most populous state', 'most populous country subdivision in the world', '1 April 1937', 'United Provinces of Agra and Oudh', '1950', '18', 'divisions', '75', 'districts', 'state capital', 'Lucknow', 'Allahabad', 'judicial capital', '9 November 2000', 'Uttarakhand', 'Ganges', 'Yamuna', 'Triveni Sangam', 'Gomti', 'Saryu', '6.1', '82', '68.5'] What do you know about the entities?

[['Uttar Pradesh', 'Capital', 'Lucknow'], ['Ganges', 'location', '68.5'], ['75', 'capital', 'state'], ['judicial capital', 'Location', 'Allahabad']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Ganges', 'location', '68.5'], ['75', 'capital', 'state']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - location - does not hold between Ganges and 68.5.', 'The relation - capital - does not hold between 75 and state.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Uttar Pradesh', 'Capital', 'Lucknow'], ['judicial capital', 'Location', 'Allahabad']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The National Geographic Society (NGS), headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States, is one of the largest non-profit scientific and educational organizations in the world. Founded in 1888, its interests include geography, archaeology, and natural science, the promotion of environmental and historical conservation, and the study of world culture and history. The National Geographic Society's logo is a yellow portrait frame—rectangular in shape—which appears on the margins surrounding the front covers of its magazines and as its television channel logo. Through National Geographic Partners (a joint venture with The Walt Disney Company), the Society operates the magazine, TV channels, a website, worldwide events, and other media operations. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['National Geographic Society', 'Washington, D.C.', 'United States', 'non-profit', 'education', '1888', 'geography', 'archaeology', 'natural science', 'environmental', 'historical', 'conservation', 'world culture', 'history', 'portrait', 'margins', 'National Geographic Partners', 'The Walt Disney Company', 'magazine', 'TV channels'] What do you know about the entities?

[['National Geographic Society', 'Inception', '1888'], ['National Geographic Society', 'Country', 'United States'], ['portrait', 'capital', 'magazine'], ['geography', 'inception', 'archaeology'], ['National Geographic Partners', 'owned by', 'The Walt Disney Company'], ['Washington, D.C.', 'country', 'United States'], ['National Geographic Partners', 'Owned by', 'National Geographic Society'], ['United States', 'Capital', 'Washington, D.C.']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['geography', 'inception', 'archaeology'], ['portrait', 'capital', 'magazine']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - inception - does not hold between geography and archaeology.', 'The relation - capital - does not hold between portrait and magazine.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['National Geographic Society', 'Country', 'United States'], ['Washington, D.C.', 'country', 'United States'], ['United States', 'Capital', 'Washington, D.C.'], ['National Geographic Society', 'Inception', '1888'], ['National Geographic Partners', 'Owned by', 'National Geographic Society'], ['National Geographic Partners', 'owned by', 'The Walt Disney Company']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: \"Bluebeard\" (, ) is a French folktale, the most famous surviving version of which was written by Charles Perrault and first published by Barbin in Paris in 1697 in \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\". The tale tells the story of a wealthy man in the habit of murdering his wives and the attempts of one wife to avoid the fate of her predecessors. \"The White Dove\", \"The Robber Bridegroom\" and \"Fitcher's Bird\" (also called \"Fowler's Fowl\") are tales similar to \"Bluebeard\". The notoriety of the tale is such that Merriam-Webster gives the word \"Bluebeard\" the definition of \"a man who marries and kills one wife after another,\" and the verb \"bluebearding\" has even appeared as a way to describe the crime of either killing a series of women, or seducing and abandoning a series of women.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The 400 metres, or 400-metre dash, is a sprinting event in track and field competitions. It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1964 for women. On a standard outdoor running track, it is one lap around the track. Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course. In many countries, athletes previously competed in the 440-yard dash (402.336 m)—which is a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile'—instead of the 400 m (437.445 yards), though this distance is now obsolete. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['400 metres', 'sprinting', 'track and field', 'athletics', 'Summer Olympics', '1896', '1964', 'running track', '440-yard dash', '402.336', 'mile', '437.445'] What do you know about the entities?

The shortest of Pynchon's novels, its narrative follows Oedipa Maas, a young Californian woman, who begins to embrace a conspiracy theory as she possibly unearths a centuries-old conflict between two mail distribution companies; one of these companies, Thurn and Taxis, actually existed (1806–1867) and was the first private firm to distribute postal mail.

Published in 1859, it applies Mill's ethical system of utilitarianism to society and state. Mill suggests standards for the relationship between authority and liberty. He emphasizes the importance of individuality, which he considers prerequisite to the higher pleasures—the \"summum bonum\" of utilitarianism. Furthermore, Mill asserts that democratic ideals may result in the \"tyranny of the majority\". Among the standards proposed are Mill's three basic liberties of individuals, his three legitimate objections to government intervention, and his two maxims regarding the relationship of the individual to society.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The site was created by Ziff Davis as an extension of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", a gaming magazine formerly published by the company. \"1Up.com\" was sold in 2009 to Hearst Corporation's UGO Networks, who was acquired by IGN Entertainment (then owned by News Corporation) in 2011. Coming full circle, Ziff Davis acquired IGN Entertainment as a whole in February 2013, re-uniting \"1Up.com\" with its original owners. Shortly after the acquisition, however, Ziff Davis announced that in an effort to concentrate on IGN, it would shut down most of its secondary sites, including \"1Up.com\". Remaining staff members from \"1Up.com\" were to be transferred to IGN. Even though the site is still up, some links are taken down, thus making the site broken. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Ziff Davis', 'Electronic Gaming Monthly', '1Up.com', '1', '2009', 'Hearst Corporation', 'UGO Networks', 'IGN Entertainment', 'News Corporation', '2011', 'February 2013'] What do you know about the entities? ['1up.com is a/an media.', '1 is a/an number.', '2009 is a/an date.', '2011 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['owned by'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['1Up.com', 'Owned by', 'IGN Entertainment'], ['Hearst Corporation', 'owned by', 'IGN Entertainment'], ['Ziff Davis', 'owned by', 'News Corporation']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Ziff Davis', 'owned by', 'News Corporation'], ['Hearst Corporation', 'owned by', 'IGN Entertainment']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - owned by - does not hold between Ziff Davis and News Corporation.', 'The relation - owned by - does not hold between Hearst Corporation and IGN Entertainment.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['1Up.com', 'Owned by', 'IGN Entertainment']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

Text: The Empire of Trebizond, or Trapezuntine Empire, was a monarchy and one of three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Laskaris and later with the Palaiologos dynasties, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors. Your answer: ",

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports drama film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. The film co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Burt Young, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki. \"Rocky IV\" was the highest-grossing sports movie of all time for 24 years, before it was overtaken by \"The Blind Side\". It is the sequel to the 1982 film \"Rocky III\" and it is the most financially successful installment in the \"Rocky\" franchise. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Rocky IV', '1985', 'sports', 'drama film', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'Dolph Lundgren', 'Burt Young', 'Talia Shire', 'Carl Weathers', 'Tony Burton', 'Brigitte Nielsen', 'Michael Pataki', '24', 'The Blind Side', '1982', 'Rocky III', '\"Rocky\" franchise'] What do you know about the entities?

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Carl Weathers', 'genre', 'Carl Weathers'], ['sports', 'director', 'Michael Pataki']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - genre - does not hold between Carl Weathers and Carl Weathers.', 'The relation - director - does not hold between sports and Michael Pataki.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Rocky IV', 'Genre', 'sports'], ['Rocky IV', 'genre', 'drama film'], ['Rocky IV', 'Director', 'Sylvester Stallone'], ['Rocky IV', 'Cast member', 'Dolph Lundgren'], ['Rocky IV', 'cast member', 'Burt Young'], ['Rocky IV', 'cast member', 'Talia Shire'], ['Rocky IV', 'cast member', 'Carl Weathers'], ['Rocky IV', 'cast member', 'Tony Burton'], ['Rocky IV', 'cast member', 'Brigitte Nielsen'], ['Rocky IV', 'cast member', 'Michael Pataki']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Titan A.E. is a 2000 American animated post-apocalyptic science fiction adventure film directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman and starring the voices of Matt Damon, Bill Pullman, Drew Barrymore, John Leguizamo, Nathan Lane, Janeane Garofalo, Ron Perlman and Tone Loc.

North Macedonia is a developing country, ranking 82nd on the Human Development Index, and provides a social security, universal health care system, and free primary and secondary education to its citizens. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['unitary', 'parliamentary', 'constitution', 'republic', 'North Macedonia', 'NATO', 'Council of Europe', 'World Bank', 'OSCE', 'CEFTA', 'BSEC', 'WTO', '2005', 'candidate for joining the European Union', 'open economy', 'developing country', '82', 'Human Development Index', 'social security', 'universal health care', 'primary and secondary education'] What do you know about the entities?

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['open economy', 'member of', 'constitution'], ['Council of Europe', 'country', 'universal health care']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - member of - does not hold between open economy and constitution.', 'The relation - country - does not hold between Council of Europe and universal health care.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['North Macedonia', 'Member of', 'NATO'], ['North Macedonia', 'member of', 'Council of Europe'], ['North Macedonia', 'member of', 'OSCE'], ['North Macedonia', 'member of', 'WTO'], ['universal health care', 'Country', 'North Macedonia'], ['primary and secondary education', 'country', 'North Macedonia']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The Offspring is often credited—alongside fellow California punk bands Green Day and Rancid—for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the 1990s. They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - follows - does not hold between 1991 and 1989.', 'The relation - follows - does not hold between 40 and Smash.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Smash', 'Follows', 'Ignition'], ['Splinter', 'follows', 'Conspiracy of One'], ['Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace', 'follows', 'Splinter'], ['Days Go By', 'follows', 'Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun\", the album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh was replaced by Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, \"Maladroit\" (2002), achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. \"Make Believe\" (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"Beverly Hills\" became Weezer's first single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and the first to reach the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: \"Bluebeard\" (, ) is a French folktale, the most famous surviving version of which was written by Charles Perrault and first published by Barbin in Paris in 1697 in \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\". The tale tells the story of a wealthy man in the habit of murdering his wives and the attempts of one wife to avoid the fate of her predecessors. \"The White Dove\", \"The Robber Bridegroom\" and \"Fitcher's Bird\" (also called \"Fowler's Fowl\") are tales similar to \"Bluebeard\". The notoriety of the tale is such that Merriam-Webster gives the word \"Bluebeard\" the definition of \"a man who marries and kills one wife after another,\" and the verb \"bluebearding\" has even appeared as a way to describe the crime of either killing a series of women, or seducing and abandoning a series of women. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Bluebeard', 'folktale', 'Charles Perrault', '1697', 'Histoires ou contes du temps passé', 'The White Dove', 'The Robber Bridegroom', \"Fitcher's Bird\", 'Merriam-Webster'] What do you know about the entities? ['Folktale is a/an concept.', '1697 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['author', 'notable work'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Bluebeard', 'Author', 'Charles Perrault'], ['Charles Perrault', 'Notable work', 'Histoires ou contes du temps passé'], ['Histoires ou contes du temps passé', 'author', 'Charles Perrault'], ['Charles Perrault', 'author', 'The White Dove'], ['The White Dove', 'notable work', 'folktale']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Charles Perrault', 'author', 'The White Dove'], ['The White Dove', 'notable work', 'folktale']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - author - does not hold between Charles Perrault and The White Dove.', 'The relation - notable work - does not hold between The White Dove and folktale.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Bluebeard', 'Author', 'Charles Perrault'], ['Charles Perrault', 'Notable work', 'Histoires ou contes du temps passé'], ['Histoires ou contes du temps passé', 'author', 'Charles Perrault']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his \"Pentamerone\" in 1634; the version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\" in 1697.

I filtered out incorrect triples by checking if the relationships between the entities make sense. For example, 'Snickers' cannot be'made by' 'nougat', 'caramel', or 'peanuts' because they are toppings, not manufacturers. Similarly, 'Snickers' cannot be 'enrobed in' 'global' or 'billion' because they are not types of chocolate or quantities. The final triples represent the correct relationships between the entities. \n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is [['",

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports drama film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. The film co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Burt Young, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki. \"Rocky IV\" was the highest-grossing sports movie of all time for 24 years, before it was overtaken by \"The Blind Side\". It is the sequel to the 1982 film \"Rocky III\" and it is the most financially successful installment in the \"Rocky\" franchise. Let's extract the entities first.

[['Saint Lucia Football Association', 'Headquarter', 'Castries']] - Correct, as the text states that the FA is headquartered in Castries, the nation's capital. \n\nThe other triples are incorrect because they are not supported by the text. For example, the text does not mention the FA being founded in 1979 or running specific teams or competitions. It only mentions that the FA was founded in 1979 and runs national teams and domestic competitions in general. \n\nTherefore, the correct triples are 1, 2, and 4. 3, 5-9 are incorrect. \n\nNote: The domain expert's thinking is crucial in this task.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets () is a 2017 English-language French 3D space opera film written and directed by Luc Besson, and co-produced by Besson and his wife, Virginie Besson-Silla. It is based on the French science fiction comics series \"Valérian and Laureline\", written by Pierre Christin and illustrated by Jean-Claude Mézières. It stars Dane DeHaan as Valerian and Cara Delevingne as Laureline, with Clive Owen, Rihanna, Ethan Hawke, Herbie Hancock, Kris Wu and Rutger Hauer in supporting roles. Besson independently financed and personally funded the film. With a production budget of around $180 million, it is both the most expensive European and independent film ever made. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', '2017', '3D', '3', 'space opera', 'Luc Besson', 'Virginie Besson-Silla', 'science fiction comics', 'Valérian and Laureline', 'Pierre Christin', 'Jean-Claude Mézières', 'Dane DeHaan', 'Cara Delevingne', 'Clive Owen', 'Rihanna', 'Ethan Hawke', 'Herbie Hancock', 'Kris Wu', 'Rutger Hauer', '$', '180', 'independent film'] What do you know about the entities?

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Clive Owen', 'director', 'independent film'], ['Jean-Claude Mézières', 'instance of', 'Pierre Christin']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - director - does not hold between Clive Owen and independent film.', 'The relation - instance of - does not hold between Jean-Claude Mézières and Pierre Christin.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', 'Instance of', '3D'], ['Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', 'Director', 'Luc Besson'], ['Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', 'Cast member', 'Dane DeHaan'], ['Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', 'cast member', 'Cara Delevingne'], ['Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', 'cast member', 'Clive Owen'], ['Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', 'cast member', 'Ethan Hawke'], ['Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', 'cast member', 'Herbie Hancock'], ['Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets', 'cast member', 'Rutger Hauer'], ['Luc Besson', 'Spouse', 'Virginie Besson-Silla'], ['Valérian and Laureline', 'Author', 'Pierre Christin']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Midnight in Paris is a 2011 fantasy comedy film written and directed by Woody Allen.

Let's use an example:\nText: The site was created by Ziff Davis as an extension of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", a gaming magazine formerly published by the company. \"1Up.com\" was sold in 2009 to Hearst Corporation's UGO Networks, who was acquired by IGN Entertainment (then owned by News Corporation) in 2011. Coming full circle, Ziff Davis acquired IGN Entertainment as a whole in February 2013, re-uniting \"1Up.com\" with its original owners. Shortly after the acquisition, however, Ziff Davis announced that in an effort to concentrate on IGN, it would shut down most of its secondary sites, including \"1Up.com\".

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Adobe InDesign is a desktop publishing and typesetting software application produced by Adobe Inc.. It can be used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and ebooks. InDesign can also publish content suitable for tablet devices in conjunction with Adobe Digital Publishing Suite. Graphic designers and production artists are the principal users, creating and laying out periodical publications, posters, and print media. It also supports export to EPUB and SWF formats to create e-books and digital publications, including digital magazines, and content suitable for consumption on tablet computers.

Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Despite the obstacles, readers and commentators have reached a broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text \"La Scienza Nuova\" (The New Science), upon which they argue \"Finnegans Wake\" is structured.

Text: In early 1795, intervention by the French Republic led to the downfall of the old Dutch Republic. The new Republic enjoyed widespread support from the Dutch populace and was the product of a genuine popular revolution. Nevertheless, it clearly was founded with the armed support of the French revolutionary forces. The Batavian Republic became a client state, the first of the \"sister-republics\", and later part of the French Empire of Napoleon. Its politics were deeply influenced by the French, who supported no fewer than three \"coups d'état\" to bring the different political factions to power that France favored at different moments in its own political development. Nevertheless, the process of creating a written Dutch constitution was mainly driven by internal political factors, not by French influence, until Napoleon forced the Dutch government to accept his brother, Louis Bonaparte, as monarch.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: İzmit was known as Nicomedia (Greek: Νικομήδεια) in antiquity, and was the eastern and most senior capital city of the Roman Empire between 286 and 324, during the Tetrarchy introduced by Diocletian. Following Constantine the Great's victory over co-emperor Licinius at the Battle of Chrysopolis in 324, Nicomedia served as an interim capital city for Constantine between 324 and 330, when he rebuilt and expanded the nearby city of Byzantium as the new Roman capital; formally dedicating it in 330 with the name \"Nova Roma\", before he soon renamed it as \"Constantinopolis\" (modern Istanbul). Constantine died at a royal villa near Nicomedia in 337. During the Ottoman Empire, İzmit was the capital of the Sanjak of Kocaeli. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['İzmit', 'Nicomedia', 'Roman Empire', 'Tetrarchy', 'Diocletian', 'Constantine the Great', 'Licinius', 'Battle of Chrysopolis', 'Byzantium', 'Nova Roma', 'Constantinopolis', 'Istanbul', 'Ottoman Empire', 'Sanjak of Kocaeli'] What do you know about the entities? [] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['follows', 'replaces'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Battle of Chrysopolis', 'follows', 'Constantinopolis'], ['Constantinopolis', 'follows', 'Nova Roma'], ['Istanbul', 'follows', 'Constantinopolis'], ['Constantinopolis', 'Replaces', 'Byzantium'], ['Nova Roma', 'Follows', 'Byzantium'], ['Sanjak of Kocaeli', 'replaces', 'Nova Roma']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Sanjak of Kocaeli', 'replaces', 'Nova Roma'], ['Battle of Chrysopolis', 'follows', 'Constantinopolis']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - replaces - does not hold between Sanjak of Kocaeli and Nova Roma.', 'The relation - follows - does not hold between Battle of Chrysopolis and Constantinopolis.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Nova Roma', 'Follows', 'Byzantium'], ['Constantinopolis', 'Replaces', 'Byzantium'], ['Constantinopolis', 'follows', 'Nova Roma'], ['Istanbul', 'follows', 'Constantinopolis']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Despite home rule, Lycia was not a sovereign state and had not been since its defeat by the Carians. In 43 AD the Roman emperor Claudius dissolved the league, and Lycia was incorporated into the Roman Empire with provincial status. It became an eparchy of the Eastern, or Byzantine Empire, continuing to speak Greek even after being joined by communities of Turkish language speakers in the early 2nd millennium. After the fall of the Byzantine Empire in the 15th century, Lycia was under the Ottoman Empire, and was inherited by the Turkish Republic on the Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Your answer: ",

She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released eight studio albums, and hosted her own Emmy-nominated television series, \"The Judy Garland Show\" (1963–1964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Uttar Pradesh (; , 'Northern Province') is a state in northern India. With over 200 million inhabitants, it is the most populous state in India as well as the most populous country subdivision in the world. It was created on 1 April 1937 as the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh during British rule, and was renamed \"Uttar Pradesh\" in 1950, giving it the acronym \"UP\". The state is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts, with the state capital being Lucknow, and Allahabad serving as the judicial capital. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand), was carved from the state's Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and Yamuna, join at Triveni Sangam in Allahabad and flow further east as Ganges. Other prominent rivers are Gomti and Saryu. The forest cover in the state is 6.1% of the state's geographical area. The cultivable area is 82% of total geographical area and net area sown is 68.5% of cultivable area. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Uttar Pradesh', 'state', 'northern India', 'most populous state', 'most populous country subdivision in the world', '1 April 1937', 'United Provinces of Agra and Oudh', '1950', '18', 'divisions', '75', 'districts', 'state capital', 'Lucknow', 'Allahabad', 'judicial capital', '9 November 2000', 'Uttarakhand', 'Ganges', 'Yamuna', 'Triveni Sangam', 'Gomti', 'Saryu', '6.1', '82', '68.5'] What do you know about the entities? ['State is a/an concept.', 'Northern india is a/an location.', 'Most populous state is a/an unknown.', 'Most populous country subdivision in the world is a/an unknown.', '1 april 1937 is a/an date.', '1950 is a/an date.', '18 is a/an number.', 'Divisions is a/an concept.', '75 is a/an number.', 'Districts is a/an unknown.', 'State capital is a/an unknown.', 'Judicial capital is a/an organization.', '9 november 2000 is a/an date.', '6.1 is a/an number.', '82 is a/an number.', '68.5 is a/an number.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['capital', 'location'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Uttar Pradesh', 'Capital', 'Lucknow'], ['Ganges', 'location', '68.5'], ['75', 'capital', 'state'], ['judicial capital', 'Location', 'Allahabad']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Ganges', 'location', '68.5'], ['75', 'capital', 'state']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - location - does not hold between Ganges and 68.5.', 'The relation - capital - does not hold between 75 and state.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Uttar Pradesh', 'Capital', 'Lucknow'], ['judicial capital', 'Location', 'Allahabad']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

Let's use an example:\nText: Chevrolet ( ), colloquially referred to as Chevy and formally the Chevrolet Division of General Motors Company, is an American automobile division of the American manufacturer General Motors (GM). Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3, 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918, and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Chevrolet', 'American automobile', 'General Motors', 'Louis Chevrolet', 'William C.

In response, the Nazi authorities suppressed the OUN leadership. In October 1942 the OUN-B established the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). In 1943–1944, in order to pre-empt Polish efforts at re-establishing Poland's pre-war borders, UPA military units carried out large-scale ethnic cleansing against Polish people.

Let's use an example:\nText: Dalmatia is a narrow belt of the east shore of the Adriatic Sea, stretching from the island of Rab in the north to the Bay of Kotor in the south. The Dalmatian Hinterland ranges in width from fifty kilometres in the north, to just a few kilometres in the south; it is mostly covered by the rugged Dinaric Alps.
