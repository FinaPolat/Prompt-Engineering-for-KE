The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and his one-time wife Meg White (drums and vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, the White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002 as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums \"White Blood Cells\" and \"Elephant\" drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom. The single \"Seven Nation Army\", which used a guitar and an octave pedal to create the iconic opening riff, became one of their most recognizable songs. The band recorded two more albums, \"Get Behind Me Satan\" in 2005 and \"Icky Thump\" in 2007, and dissolved in 2011 after a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording. Your answer: ",

The system used VHS tape technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of \"Night Trap\" commenced. The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

He is one of the most re-imagined characters in children's literature. His story has been adapted into many other media, notably the 1940 Disney film \"Pinocchio\". Collodi often used the Italian Tuscan dialect in his book. The name \"\" is a combination of the Italian words \"\" (pine), and \"occhio\" (eye); \"Pino\" is also an abbreviation of \"Giuseppino\", the diminutive for Giuseppe (the Italian form of Joseph); one of the men who greatly influenced Collodi in his youth was Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist who supervised Collodi at the \"Libreria Piatti\" bookshop in Florence.

Initially the PDPA was highly represented in the government cabinet, but many were later fired as relations with President Daoud Khan were worsened. In 1978 the PDPA, with help from members of the Afghan National Army, seized power from Daoud Khan in what is known as the Saur Revolution. The PDPA led by Nur Muhammad Taraki established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan which would last until 1987. After National Reconciliation talks in 1987 the official name of the country was reverted to \"Republic of Afghanistan\" (as it was known prior to 1978). Under the leadership of Mohammad Najibullah in 1990, the party's name was changed to Homeland Party (حزب وطن, \"Hezb-e Watan\") and much of the party's communist symbols and policies were altered or removed.

The system used VHS tape technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of \"Night Trap\" commenced. The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

From 1948 to 1989, Czechoslovakia was part of the Eastern Bloc with a command economy. Its economic status was formalized in membership of Comecon from 1949 and its defense status in the Warsaw Pact of May 1955. A period of political liberalization in 1968, known as the Prague Spring, was violently ended when the Soviet Union, assisted by some other Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. In 1989, as Marxist–Leninist governments and communism were ending all over Europe, Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their Socialist Government in the Velvet Revolution; state price controls were removed after a period of preparation.

The club was founded in 1945 by people expelled from Lwów, who were supporters of Poland's oldest football team Lechia Lwów, founded in 1903. The club's name comes from Lechia, a poetic name for Poland, and is a continuation of the name used by the club based in Lwów. In their early years, Lechia enjoyed some success, most notably finishing third in the Polish top division, before spending decades in the second and third tiers. In the early 1980s, Lechia won the Polish Cup, the Polish SuperCup, and played in a European competition for the first time. After having two mergers with other teams in the 1990s the club had to restart from the sixth tier in 2001. In May 2008 the club was promoted again to the Ekstraklasa, with the club's most recent success coming in 2019, finishing third in the league and again winning both the Polish Cup and SuperCup.

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

Text: Despite struggling in the 1880s and 1890s, the Pirates were among the best teams in baseball shortly after the turn of the 20th century. They won three NL titles from 1901 to 1903, played in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and won their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They also won the 1971 World Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \"We Are Family\", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell. After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s, the Pirates struggled mightily over the following decades with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in American professional sports history. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2013 and advanced to the NLDS. The team qualified for the postseason again in 2014 and 2015. The Pirates currently have the sixth-longest World Series championship drought (behind the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Mariners—all except the Indians have never won a World Series), second-longest World Series appearance drought in Major League Baseball (behind only the Mariners, who have never appeared in a World Series), the longest pennant drought in the National League (their most recent showing being their victory in the 1979 World Series), and the longest League Championship Series appearance drought in either league. From 1882 to 2020, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,564–10,446 ( winning 'percentage') Your answer: ",

The system used VHS tape technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of \"Night Trap\" commenced. The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.

The system used VHS tape technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of \"Night Trap\" commenced. The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

Text: AOL was one of the early pioneers of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the United States. It originally provided a dial-up service to millions of Americans, as well as providing a web portal, e-mail, instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of Netscape. In 2001, at the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly shrunk thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of broadband. AOL was eventually spun off from Time Warner in 2009, with Tim Armstrong appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies. Your answer: ",

These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini.

After a brief membership in the Athenian Empire, it seceded and became independent (its treaty with Athens had omitted the usual non-secession clause), was under the Persians again, revolted again, was conquered by Mausolus of Caria, returned to the Persians, and finally fell under Macedonian hegemony upon the defeat of the Persians by Alexander the Great. Due to the influx of Greek speakers and the sparsity of the remaining Lycian speakers, Lycia was rapidly Hellenized under the Macedonians, and the Lycian language disappeared from inscriptions and coinage.

Collodi often used the Italian Tuscan dialect in his book. The name \"\" is a combination of the Italian words \"\" (pine), and \"occhio\" (eye); \"Pino\" is also an abbreviation of \"Giuseppino\", the diminutive for Giuseppe (the Italian form of Joseph); one of the men who greatly influenced Collodi in his youth was Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist who supervised Collodi at the \"Libreria Piatti\" bookshop in Florence.

While in Paris during the 1940s, he joined the French Communist Party. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he involved himself in the Marxist–Leninist Khmer Việt Minh organisation and its guerrilla war against King Norodom Sihanouk's newly independent government. Following the Khmer Việt Minh's 1954 retreat into Marxist–Leninist controlled North Vietnam, Pol Pot returned to Phnom Penh, working as a teacher while remaining a central member of Cambodia's Marxist–Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped formalise the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party, which was later renamed the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). To avoid state repression, in 1962 he relocated to a jungle encampment and in 1963 became the CPK's leader. In 1968, he relaunched the war against Sihanouk's government. After Lon Nol ousted Sihanouk in a 1970 coup, Pol Pot's forces sided with the deposed leader against the new government, which was bolstered by the United States military.

After the French took over northern Vietnam through the Tonkin campaign, the various protectorates were consolidated into one union in 1887. Two more entities were incorporated into the union: the Laotian protectorate and the Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan. The French exploited the resources in the region during their rule, but also contributed to improvements of the health and education system in the region. Nevertheless, deep divides remained between the natives and the colonists, leading to sporadic rebellions by the former. After the Fall of France during World War II, the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945, when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime. After the Japanese surrender, the Viet Minh, a communist organization led by Hồ Chí Minh, declared Vietnamese independence, but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina.

Their debut album \"Spice\" (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Their follow-up album, \"Spiceworld\" (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 14 million copies worldwide. Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and consistent lyrical theme of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the five members. In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, \"Forever\", was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting. Since then, the group have reunited for two concert tours, the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019), both of which won the \"Billboard\" Live Music Award for the highest-grossing engagements of their respective years.

The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

Text: William Penn (14 October 1644 – 30 July 1718) was an English writer and religious thinker belonging to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, a North American colony of England. He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed. Philadelphia was planned out to be grid-like with its streets and be very easy to navigate, unlike London where Penn was from. The streets are named with numbers and tree names. He chose to use the names of trees for the cross streets because Pennsylvania means \"Penn's Woods\". Your answer: ",

Text: In 1681, King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn's father, the admiral and politician Sir William Penn. This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil, sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, (past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies) in New Castle (now in Delaware) in 1682. On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor, and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held. Afterward, Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia, on the west bank. However, Penn's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch, Swedish colonists, and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware, but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland's proprietor family, the Calverts and Lord Baltimore. These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a \"Pennsylvania\", so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly. Twenty-three years later in 1704, they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware, were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential settlement in the new colony, New Castle, the original Swedish colony town became the capital. Your answer: ",

The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Your answer: ",

It causes Lyme disease, also called Lyme borreliosis, a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by ticks and by lice, depending on the species of bacteria.

This bacterium must be viewed using dark-field microscopy, which make the cells appear white against a dark background. \"Borrelia\" species are grown in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium. Of 52 known species of \"Borrelia\", 21 are members of the Lyme disease group, 29 belong to the relapsing fever group, and two are members of a genetically distinct third group typically found in reptiles. The Lyme disease group has been moved to their own genus, \"Borelliella\", but this change is not yet widely accepted. This bacterium uses hard and soft ticks and lice as vectors.

The name \"\" is a combination of the Italian words \"\" (pine), and \"occhio\" (eye); \"Pino\" is also an abbreviation of \"Giuseppino\", the diminutive for Giuseppe (the Italian form of Joseph); one of the men who greatly influenced Collodi in his youth was Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist who supervised Collodi at the \"Libreria Piatti\" bookshop in Florence. Geppetto, the name of Pinocchio's creator and “father,” is the diminutive for Geppo, the Tuscan pronunciation of \"ceppo\", meaning a log, stump, block, stock or stub.

Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: This is a list of Florida death metal bands. Death metal is a genre of extreme heavy metal music that is characterized by musically by fast, distorted, down-tuned, and sometimes palm-muted guitar instrumentation, growled and screamed vocals, and hyper-fast, blast beat drumming. The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre. The scene declined in the second half of the 1990s but subsequently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Obituary, and Death collectively sold over five-million albums. Your answer: ",

Let's use a few examples:\nText: The narrative takes as its literal subject the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward, and describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven. Allegorically the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (\"Inferno\"), followed by the penitent Christian life (\"Purgatorio\"), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (\"Paradiso\"). Dante draws on medieval Roman Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the \"Summa Theologica\" of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the \"Divine Comedy\" has been called \"the \"Summa\" in verse\". In Dante's work, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil (who represents human reason), Beatrice (who represents divine revelation, theology, faith, and grace), and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother). Erich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues; this along with the fully imagined world of the \"Divine Comedy\", different from our own but fully visualized, suggests that the \"Divine Comedy\" could be said to have inaugurated realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction.

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536, but later abandoned it in 1620 with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited. An English ship, the \"Olive Blossom\", arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625; its men took possession of the island in the name of King James I. In 1627, the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and Barbados became an English and later British colony. During this period, the colony operated on a plantation economy, relying on the labour of enslaved Africans which worked on the island's plantations.

Text: Confederate Ireland was the period of Irish Catholic self-government between 1642 and 1649, during the Eleven Years' War. During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press. Confederate ambassadors were appointed and recognised in France, Spain and the Papal States, who supplied the Confederates with money and weapons. Your answer: ",

Let's use a few examples:\nText: In the 9th century, Merv was briefly the seat of the caliph al-Ma'mun and the capital of the entire Islamic caliphate. During the 12th and 13th centuries, it became one of the largest cities in the world, having a population of as many as 500,000.

Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - part of - does not hold between caliph and Merv.', 'The relation - part of - does not hold between 9 and 500,000.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Islamic caliphate', 'Part of', 'caliph']].\nText: His brothers' attempted coup had been unexpected and troublesome for Esarhaddon and he would be plagued by paranoia and mistrust for his officials, governors and male family members until the end of his reign. As a result of this paranoia, most of the palaces used by Esarhaddon were high-security fortifications located outside of the major population centers of the cities. Also perhaps resulting from his mistrust for his male relatives, Esarhaddon's female relatives, such as his mother Naqi'a and his daughter Serua-eterat, were allowed to wield considerably more influence and political power during his reign than women had been allowed in any previous period of Assyrian history.

He also completed the \"Nekhenre\", the Sun temple of Userkaf in Abu Gorab, and the valley temple of Menkaure in Giza. In doing so, he was the first king since Shepseskaf, last ruler of the Fourth Dynasty, to pay attention to the Giza necropolis, a move which may have been an attempt to legitimise his rule following the troubled times surrounding the unexpected death of his brother Neferefre.

It causes Lyme disease, also called Lyme borreliosis, a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by ticks and by lice, depending on the species of bacteria. The genus is named after French biologist Amédée Borrel (1867–1936), who first documented the distinction between a species of \"Borrelia\", \"B. anserina\", and the other known type of spirochete at the time, \"Treponema pallidum\". This bacterium must be viewed using dark-field microscopy, which make the cells appear white against a dark background. \"Borrelia\" species are grown in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium. Of 52 known species of \"Borrelia\", 21 are members of the Lyme disease group, 29 belong to the relapsing fever group, and two are members of a genetically distinct third group typically found in reptiles. The Lyme disease group has been moved to their own genus, \"Borelliella\", but this change is not yet widely accepted. This bacterium uses hard and soft ticks and lice as vectors.

Text: Dip Top Peak is a 7,291-foot-elevation (2,222 meter) mountain summit located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in eastern King County of Washington state. It is part of the Cascade Range and is set on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The peak is situated north of Mount Daniel, and less than one mile south of Jade Lake. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into East Fork Foss River, which is a tributary of the Skykomish River. The summit saddle has two rock horns, of which the higher southwest peak is the true summit. The first ascent was made August 1950 by Bill and Gene Prater. In the early 1970s, brothers Gene and Bill Prater created the modern aluminum snowshoe known today, and sold them via Bill's \"Sherpa Snowshoes\" company, which proved very popular. Your answer: ",

Text: The Empire of Trebizond, or Trapezuntine Empire, was a monarchy and one of three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes.

The Despotate of Epirus had ceased to contest the Byzantine throne even before the Nicaean reconquest and was briefly occupied by the restored Byzantine Empire , thereafter becoming a Serbian dependency later inherited by Italians, ultimately falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1479. Whilst the Empire of Nicaea had restored the Byzantine Empire through restoring control of the capital, it ended in 1453 with the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. Trebizond lasted until 1461 when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered it after a month-long siege and took its ruler and his family into captivity, marking the final end of the Roman imperial tradition initiated by Augustus 1,488 years previously.

Along with Irving's companion piece \"Rip Van Winkle\", \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" is among the earliest examples of American fiction with enduring popularity, especially during Halloween because of a character known as the Headless Horseman believed to be a Hessian soldier who was decapitated by a cannonball in battle. In 1949, the second film adaptation was produced by Walt Disney as one of two segments in the package film \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\". Your answer: ",

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

He is one of the most re-imagined characters in children's literature. His story has been adapted into many other media, notably the 1940 Disney film \"Pinocchio\". Collodi often used the Italian Tuscan dialect in his book. The name \"\" is a combination of the Italian words \"\" (pine), and \"occhio\" (eye); \"Pino\" is also an abbreviation of \"Giuseppino\", the diminutive for Giuseppe (the Italian form of Joseph); one of the men who greatly influenced Collodi in his youth was Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist who supervised Collodi at the \"Libreria Piatti\" bookshop in Florence.

It causes Lyme disease, also called Lyme borreliosis, a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by ticks and by lice, depending on the species of bacteria. The genus is named after French biologist Amédée Borrel (1867–1936), who first documented the distinction between a species of \"Borrelia\", \"B. anserina\", and the other known type of spirochete at the time, \"Treponema pallidum\". This bacterium must be viewed using dark-field microscopy, which make the cells appear white against a dark background. \"Borrelia\" species are grown in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium. Of 52 known species of \"Borrelia\", 21 are members of the Lyme disease group, 29 belong to the relapsing fever group, and two are members of a genetically distinct third group typically found in reptiles. The Lyme disease group has been moved to their own genus, \"Borelliella\", but this change is not yet widely accepted. This bacterium uses hard and soft ticks and lice as vectors.

Let's use a few examples:\nText: The narrative takes as its literal subject the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward, and describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven. Allegorically the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (\"Inferno\"), followed by the penitent Christian life (\"Purgatorio\"), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (\"Paradiso\"). Dante draws on medieval Roman Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the \"Summa Theologica\" of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the \"Divine Comedy\" has been called \"the \"Summa\" in verse\". In Dante's work, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil (who represents human reason), Beatrice (who represents divine revelation, theology, faith, and grace), and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother). Erich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues; this along with the fully imagined world of the \"Divine Comedy\", different from our own but fully visualized, suggests that the \"Divine Comedy\" could be said to have inaugurated realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction.

The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle.

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

He is one of the most re-imagined characters in children's literature. His story has been adapted into many other media, notably the 1940 Disney film \"Pinocchio\". Collodi often used the Italian Tuscan dialect in his book. The name \"\" is a combination of the Italian words \"\" (pine), and \"occhio\" (eye); \"Pino\" is also an abbreviation of \"Giuseppino\", the diminutive for Giuseppe (the Italian form of Joseph); one of the men who greatly influenced Collodi in his youth was Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist who supervised Collodi at the \"Libreria Piatti\" bookshop in Florence.

Text: Located on the Brunswick Peninsula north of the Strait of Magellan, Punta Arenas was originally established by the Chilean government in 1848 as a tiny penal colony to assert sovereignty over the Strait. During the remainder of the 1800s, Punta Arenas grew in size and importance due to the increasing maritime traffic and trade travelling to the west coasts of South and North America. This period of growth also resulted from the waves of European immigrants, mainly from Croatia and Russia attracted to the gold rush and sheep farming boom in the 1880s and early 1900s. The largest sheep company, controlling 10,000 square kilometres in Chile and Argentina, was based in Punta Arenas, and its owners lived there. Your answer: ",
