Text: \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1843. It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator's sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy pale blue \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering the body in the bathtub and hiding it under the floorboards.

The capital is Washington, D.C. The population is approximately 328.2 million people. The official language is English. The currency is the United States dollar.  The United States is a federal republic consisting of 50 states, a federal district, and various territories. The states and territories are divided into 31 constituent parts, commonly referred to as counties in 48 states and parishes in Louisiana. Counties are administrative or political subdivisions of a state or territory.  Counties are responsible for many local government functions, including law enforcement, record-keeping, and road maintenance. The federal district is the seat of the federal government of the United States. The federal district is not a U.S. state, but rather a separate federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress. The federal district is made up of the independent city of Washington and three territories: the District of Columbia, the Potomac River area, and the portion of Maryland adjacent to the city.  The U.S. Constitution provides that the federal district shall constitute a \"District where the seat of the Government of the United States shall be,\" and that \"The Congress shall have the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District.\" The U.S. Congress passed the Organic Act of 1871, which formally organized the federal district as a single entity, distinct from the states of Maryland and Virginia. The Organic Act established a single municipal government for the entire federal district, and provided that the district would be governed by a mayor and council.  The federal district was renamed the District of Columbia in 1871. The District of Columbia is governed by a mayor and a 13-member council, with the mayor serving as the executive and the council serving as the legislative body. The District of Columbia is also home to the United States Capitol, the Supreme Court building, and the White House, which is the residence and workplace of the President of the United States"

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959).

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times.

The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They also won the 1971 World Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \"We Are Family\", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell. After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s, the Pirates struggled mightily over the following decades with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in American professional sports history.

Text: Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

Text: The Spice Girls were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \"Wannabe\" in 1996; it hit number one in 37 countries and commenced their global success. Their debut album \"Spice\" (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Their follow-up album, \"Spiceworld\" (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 14 million copies worldwide. Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and consistent lyrical theme of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the five members. In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, \"Forever\", was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting. Since then, the group have reunited for two concert tours, the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019), both of which won the \"Billboard\" Live Music Award for the highest-grossing engagements of their respective years.

Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959).

Text: William Penn (14 October 1644 – 30 July 1718) was an English writer and religious thinker belonging to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, a North American colony of England. He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed. Philadelphia was planned out to be grid-like with its streets and be very easy to navigate, unlike London where Penn was from. The streets are named with numbers and tree names. He chose to use the names of trees for the cross streets because Pennsylvania means \"Penn's Woods\". Your answer: ",

Text: In 1681, King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn's father, the admiral and politician Sir William Penn. This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil, sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, (past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies) in New Castle (now in Delaware) in 1682. On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor, and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held. Afterward, Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia, on the west bank. However, Penn's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch, Swedish colonists, and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware, but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland's proprietor family, the Calverts and Lord Baltimore. These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a \"Pennsylvania\", so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly. Twenty-three years later in 1704, they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware, were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential settlement in the new colony, New Castle, the original Swedish colony town became the capital. Your answer: ",

Here is an example:\nText: La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548, by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza, who was born in Garrovillas de Alconétar (Cáceres), at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potosí and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally \"Nuestra Señora de La Paz\" (meaning \"Our Lady of Peace\") in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist Túpac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated.

Text: In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the \"defensive\" team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw.

Extract the triples from the following text thinking step by step. Text: This is a list of Florida death metal bands. Death metal is a genre of extreme heavy metal music that is characterized by musically by fast, distorted, down-tuned, and sometimes palm-muted guitar instrumentation, growled and screamed vocals, and hyper-fast, blast beat drumming. The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre. The scene declined in the second half of the 1990s but subsequently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Obituary, and Death collectively sold over five-million albums. Your answer: ",

Here is an example:\nText: Panic! at the Disco is the solo project of American musician Brendon Urie. It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\" (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\" (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style.

During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press.

Through Operation Alsos, Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet atomic spies successfully penetrated the program. The first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the Trinity test, conducted at New Mexico's Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range on 16 July 1945. Little Boy and Fat Man bombs were used a month later in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively, with Manhattan Project personnel serving as bomb assembly technicians, and as weaponeers on the attack aircraft. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads, developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of national laboratories, supported medical research into radiology and laid the foundations for the nuclear navy.

Here is an example:\nText: Multituberculata (commonly known as multituberculates, named for the multiple tubercles of their teeth) is an extinct taxon of rodent-like allotherian mammals that existed for approximately 166 million years, the longest fossil history of any mammal lineage. They eventually declined from the late Paleocene onwards, disappearing from the known fossil record in the late Eocene, though gondwanatheres lived into the Miocene, and may have been multituberculates. More than 200 species are known, ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These species occupied a diversity of ecological niches, ranging from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like arborealism to jerboa-like hoppers. Multituberculates are usually placed as crown mammals outside either of the two main groups of living mammals—Theria, including placentals and marsupials, and Monotremata—but closer to Theria than to monotremes.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times.

He emphasizes the importance of individuality, which he considers prerequisite to the higher pleasures—the \"summum bonum\" of utilitarianism. Furthermore, Mill asserts that democratic ideals may result in the \"tyranny of the majority\". Among the standards proposed are Mill's three basic liberties of individuals, his three legitimate objections to government intervention, and his two maxims regarding the relationship of the individual to society.

Text: The Empire of Trebizond, or Trapezuntine Empire, was a monarchy and one of three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Laskaris and later with the Palaiologos dynasties, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors. Your answer: ",

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times.

The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle.

Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959).
