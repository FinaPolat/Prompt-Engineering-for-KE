Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians.

Here are a few examples:\nText: Sellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles.

Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times.

The group signed with major label MCA Records to co-distribute its second album, \"Dude Ranch\" (1997). Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. The group's next two releases, \"Enema of the State\" (1999) and \"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket\" (2001), were enormous successes on the strength of radio and MTV airplay. \"Blink-182\" followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group. DeLonge quit in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an \"indefinite hiatus\". They reunited in 2009, producing the trio's sixth album, \"Neighborhoods\" (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited and was replaced by Alkaline Trio frontman Matt Skiba, with their resulting seventh studio album, \"California\", being released on July 1, 2016.

Text: Despite struggling in the 1880s and 1890s, the Pirates were among the best teams in baseball shortly after the turn of the 20th century. They won three NL titles from 1901 to 1903, played in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and won their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They also won the 1971 World Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \"We Are Family\", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell. After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s, the Pirates struggled mightily over the following decades with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in American professional sports history. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2013 and advanced to the NLDS. The team qualified for the postseason again in 2014 and 2015.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Text: Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017.

After the French took over northern Vietnam through the Tonkin campaign, the various protectorates were consolidated into one union in 1887. Two more entities were incorporated into the union: the Laotian protectorate and the Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan. The French exploited the resources in the region during their rule, but also contributed to improvements of the health and education system in the region. Nevertheless, deep divides remained between the natives and the colonists, leading to sporadic rebellions by the former. After the Fall of France during World War II, the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945, when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime. After the Japanese surrender, the Viet Minh, a communist organization led by Hồ Chí Minh, declared Vietnamese independence, but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina.

Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959).

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times.

For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error.

However, if you prefer to avoid this, you can omit it and focus on the events and teams.\n\nIf you want to include the \"2020 Summer Olympics\" as an entity, you can consider it as a \"sporting event\" entity, and the relation could be \"participated in\" instead of \"member of.\" In that case, the triples would be:\n[['Maartje Keuning', 'Participated in', '2020 Summer Olympics'], ['Maartje Keuning', 'Member of', 'Netherlands women\\'s national water polo team']]\nHowever, since the original text mentions \"team,\" it's more appropriate to use \"member of\" for the relation.\n\nSo, the most accurate triples based on the text provided are:\n[['Maartje Keuning',"

Death metal is a genre of extreme heavy metal music that is characterized by musically by fast, distorted, down-tuned, and sometimes palm-muted guitar instrumentation, growled and screamed vocals, and hyper-fast, blast beat drumming. The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre.

Text: Idiocracy is a 2006 American dystopian science fiction comedy film directed by Mike Judge and co-written by Judge and Etan Cohen. Starring Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, and Dax Shepard, it follows an American soldier who takes part in a classified hibernation experiment, only to be accidentally frozen for too long and awaken 500 years later in a dystopian world where dysgenics and commercialism have run rampant, mankind has embraced anti-intellectualism, and society is devoid of such traits as intellectual curiosity, social responsibility, justice, and human rights. The film was not screened for critics, and the distributor, 20th Century Fox, was accused of abandoning it.

It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\" (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\" (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press.

Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959).

Text: The Empire of Trebizond, or Trapezuntine Empire, was a monarchy and one of three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes.

The Despotate of Epirus had ceased to contest the Byzantine throne even before the Nicaean reconquest and was briefly occupied by the restored Byzantine Empire , thereafter becoming a Serbian dependency later inherited by Italians, ultimately falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1479. Whilst the Empire of Nicaea had restored the Byzantine Empire through restoring control of the capital, it ended in 1453 with the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. Trebizond lasted until 1461 when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered it after a month-long siege and took its ruler and his family into captivity, marking the final end of the Roman imperial tradition initiated by Augustus 1,488 years previously.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians.

Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times.

Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle.
