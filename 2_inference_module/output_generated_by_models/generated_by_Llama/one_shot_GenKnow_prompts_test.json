The code defines a function `extract_triples` that takes a text as input and returns a list of triples. The function first generates knowledge about entities and relations in the text. It then uses this knowledge to extract triples from the text. The `generate_knowledge` function generates knowledge about entities and relations in the text. It uses a dictionary to store the knowledge. The `extract_triples` function uses this dictionary to extract triples. The `extract_entities` function extracts entities from the text. It uses a regular expression to extract entities. The `extract_relations` function extracts relations from the text. It uses a regular expression to extract relations. The `extract_triples` function combines the knowledge generated by the `generate_knowledge` function with the entities and relations extracted by the `extract_entities` and `extract_relations` functions to extract triples. The `generate_knowledge` function uses the entities and relations to generate knowledge about entities and relations in the text. It uses a dictionary to store the knowledge. The `generate_knowledge` function iterates over the entities and relations to generate knowledge. The `generate_knowledge` function uses the knowledge generated by the `generate_knowledge` function to generate knowledge about entities and relations in the text. The `generate_knowledge` function returns the knowledge generated by the `generate_knowledge` function. The `extract_triples` function uses the knowledge generated by the `generate_knowledge` function to extract triples. The `extract_triples` function returns a list of triples.

The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and his one-time wife Meg White (drums and vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, the White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002 as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums \"White Blood Cells\" and \"Elephant\" drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom. The single \"Seven Nation Army\", which used a guitar and an octave pedal to create the iconic opening riff, became one of their most recognizable songs. The band recorded two more albums, \"Get Behind Me Satan\" in 2005 and \"Icky Thump\" in 2007, and dissolved in 2011 after a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording. Your answer: ",

It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\" (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\" (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut.

Here is an example:\nText: Sellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times.

The creature is solely attested in the \"Prose Edda\", composed in the 13th century by Icelander Snorri Sturluson. Scholars identify her as stemming from a very early stratum of Germanic mythology, and ultimately belonging to larger complex of primordial bovines or cow-associated goddesses.

Text: Despite struggling in the 1880s and 1890s, the Pirates were among the best teams in baseball shortly after the turn of the 20th century. They won three NL titles from 1901 to 1903, played in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and won their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They also won the 1971 World Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \"We Are Family\", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell. After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s, the Pirates struggled mightily over the following decades with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in American professional sports history. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2013 and advanced to the NLDS. The team qualified for the postseason again in 2014 and 2015. The Pirates currently have the sixth-longest World Series championship drought (behind the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Mariners—all except the Indians have never won a World Series), second-longest World Series appearance drought in Major League Baseball (behind only the Mariners, who have never appeared in a World Series), the longest pennant drought in the National League (their most recent showing being their victory in the 1979 World Series), and the longest League Championship Series appearance drought in either league. From 1882 to 2020, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,564–10,446 ( winning 'percentage') Your answer: ",

Text: Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini.

Text: The Spice Girls were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \"Wannabe\" in 1996; it hit number one in 37 countries and commenced their global success. Their debut album \"Spice\" (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Their follow-up album, \"Spiceworld\" (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 14 million copies worldwide. Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and consistent lyrical theme of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the five members. In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, \"Forever\", was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting. Since then, the group have reunited for two concert tours, the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019), both of which won the \"Billboard\" Live Music Award for the highest-grossing engagements of their respective years.

Here is an example:\nText: Sellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category. Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers \"one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century\".

Text: William Penn (14 October 1644 – 30 July 1718) was an English writer and religious thinker belonging to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, a North American colony of England. He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed. Philadelphia was planned out to be grid-like with its streets and be very easy to navigate, unlike London where Penn was from. The streets are named with numbers and tree names. He chose to use the names of trees for the cross streets because Pennsylvania means \"Penn's Woods\". Your answer: ",

Text: In 1681, King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn's father, the admiral and politician Sir William Penn. This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil, sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, (past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies) in New Castle (now in Delaware) in 1682. On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor, and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held. Afterward, Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia, on the west bank. However, Penn's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch, Swedish colonists, and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware, but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland's proprietor family, the Calverts and Lord Baltimore. These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a \"Pennsylvania\", so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly. Twenty-three years later in 1704, they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware, were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential settlement in the new colony, New Castle, the original Swedish colony town became the capital. Your answer: ",

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist Túpac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated.

An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error.

Death metal is a genre of extreme heavy metal music that is characterized by musically by fast, distorted, down-tuned, and sometimes palm-muted guitar instrumentation, growled and screamed vocals, and hyper-fast, blast beat drumming. The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre. The scene declined in the second half of the 1990s but subsequently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Obituary, and Death collectively sold over five-million albums. Your answer: ",

It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\" (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\" (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style.

Text: Confederate Ireland was the period of Irish Catholic self-government between 1642 and 1649, during the Eleven Years' War. During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press. Confederate ambassadors were appointed and recognised in France, Spain and the Papal States, who supplied the Confederates with money and weapons. Your answer: ",

I hope it is correct.  #### More Language Models\n\n### Model Explanation\n\nThe model is a natural language processing (NLP) model that is designed to extract knowledge triples from text. The model consists of two main components: a knowledge generator and a triple extractor.\n\nThe knowledge generator is responsible for generating knowledge about the entities mentioned in the text. This includes generating concepts, dates, and other types of knowledge that can be used to extract triples. The knowledge generator uses a combination of natural language processing techniques, such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing, to identify the entities and relationships mentioned in the text.\n\nThe triple extractor is responsible for extracting triples from the text based on the knowledge generated by the knowledge generator. The triple extractor uses a combination of logical rules and machine learning algorithms to identify the subjects, predicates, and objects of the triples, and to determine the relationships between them.\n\nThe model is trained on a large corpus of text data, and is designed to be able to extract triples from a wide range of text genres and styles. The model is also designed to be able to handle ambiguity and uncertainty in the text, and to be able to extract triples even when the text is incomplete or ambiguous.\n\n### Model Architecture\n\nThe model architecture consists of the following components:\n\n1. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text is preprocessed to remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, and tokenize the text into individual words or tokens.\n2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: The preprocessed text is then passed through a NER model to identify named entities such as people, organizations, and locations.\n3. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: The preprocessed text is then passed through a POS tagging model to identify the part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) of each word in the text.\n4. **Dependency Parsing**: The"

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Text: Poor Mrs. Jones (1926) is a 46 minute, black and white comedy, drama and family silent film produced by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1925 and released in 1926. It was directed by Raymond Evans, a former newspaperman. Shot on location in Washington, DC and at a farm in Maryland, the film features Gone with the Wind actress Leona Roberts as Jane Jones, a 1920s rural housewife tired of a grueling and unglamorous day-to-day life. She takes a vacation to the city where she stays with her sister Hattie, played by Maud Howell Smith. The USDA produced this film as 1920s propaganda promoting agriculture and farm life as more virtuous and wholesome than life in the city. Your answer: ",

Text: The Empire of Trebizond, or Trapezuntine Empire, was a monarchy and one of three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Laskaris and later with the Palaiologos dynasties, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors. Your answer: ",

Whilst the Empire of Nicaea had restored the Byzantine Empire through restoring control of the capital, it ended in 1453 with the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. Trebizond lasted until 1461 when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered it after a month-long siege and took its ruler and his family into captivity, marking the final end of the Roman imperial tradition initiated by Augustus 1,488 years previously.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles.

Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959).

It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, \"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\" (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, \"Pretty. Odd.\" (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

Text: Despite the obstacles, readers and commentators have reached a broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text \"La Scienza Nuova\" (The New Science), upon which they argue \"Finnegans Wake\" is structured.

Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962) and \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964), \"What's New, Pussycat?\" (1965), \"Casino Royale\" (1967), \"The Party\" (1968), \"Being There\" (1979) and five films of the \"Pink Panther\" series (1963–1978). Sellers' versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Being There\", and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice, for \"I'm All Right Jack\" and for the original Pink Panther film, \"The Pink Panther\" (1963) and was nominated as Best Actor three times. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \"Being There\", and was previously nominated three times in the same category.

She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released eight studio albums, and hosted her own Emmy-nominated television series, \"The Judy Garland Show\" (1963–1964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Before extracting triples, generate knowledge about the entities in the text and potential relations between them. Here is an example:\nText: It is bordered by the states of Sinaloa to the northwest, Durango to the north, Zacatecas to the northeast and Jalisco to the south. To the west, Nayarit has a significant share of coastline on the Pacific Ocean, including the islands of Marías and Marietas. The beaches of San Blas and the so-called \"Riviera Nayarit\" are popular with tourists.  Knowledge: [] The following triples can be extracted considering the knowledge. Triples: [['Durango', 'Shares border with', 'Zacatecas'], ['Marías', 'Located in or next to body of water', 'Pacific Ocean'], ['Marietas', 'located in or next to body of water', 'Pacific Ocean']] \nExample ends here. Generate knowledge as shown in the example and extract knowledge triples from the text. Text: Located on the Brunswick Peninsula north of the Strait of Magellan, Punta Arenas was originally established by the Chilean government in 1848 as a tiny penal colony to assert sovereignty over the Strait. During the remainder of the 1800s, Punta Arenas grew in size and importance due to the increasing maritime traffic and trade travelling to the west coasts of South and North America. This period of growth also resulted from the waves of European immigrants, mainly from Croatia and Russia attracted to the gold rush and sheep farming boom in the 1880s and early 1900s. The largest sheep company, controlling 10,000 square kilometres in Chile and Argentina, was based in Punta Arenas, and its owners lived there. Your answer: ",
