It features a minimalist plot in which the main character, Willie, is visited by Eva, his cousin from Hungary. Eva stays with him for ten days before going to Cleveland. Willie and his friend Eddie go to Cleveland to visit her, and the three then take a trip to Florida. The film is shot entirely in single long takes with no standard coverage. Your answer: ",

You can use regular expressions to extract the triples. You can use the following steps: 1. Split the text into sentences. 2. For each sentence, extract the subject, predicate, and object using regular expressions. 3. Store the triples in a list. 4. Return the list in json format. Here is a Python solution:  import re  def extract_triples(text):  triples = []  sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]', text)  for sentence in sentences:    sentence = sentence.strip()    if sentence:      subject = re.search(r'([A-Za-z0-9\\s]+) is a (.+) or (.+)', sentence).group(1)      if subject:        predicate = re.search(r'([A-Za-z0-9\\s]+) is a (.+) or (.+)', sentence).group(2)        if predicate:          object = re.search(r'([A-Za-z0-9\\s]+) is a (.+) or (.+)', sentence).group(3)          if object:            triples.append([subject, predicate, object])  return json.dumps(triples)  print(extract_triples(text))  This solution uses regular expressions to extract the subject, predicate, and object from each sentence. The regular expressions are designed to match common patterns in the text, such as \"The [subject] is a [predicate] or [object]\". The solution also uses the `json` module to convert the list of triples to a json string. Note that this solution is not perfect and may not work for all texts. You may need to adjust the regular expressions or add additional logic to handle edge cases.  You can also use Stanford CoreNLP to extract the triples. It is a Java library that provides a wide range of natural language processing tools, including part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing. You can use the following code to extract the triples:  import java.io.StringReader;  import java.util.ArrayList;  import java.util.List; "

Text: Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal, FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed.

After the French took over northern Vietnam through the Tonkin campaign, the various protectorates were consolidated into one union in 1887. Two more entities were incorporated into the union: the Laotian protectorate and the Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan.

Nevertheless, deep divides remained between the natives and the colonists, leading to sporadic rebellions by the former. After the Fall of France during World War II, the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945, when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime. After the Japanese surrender, the Viet Minh, a communist organization led by Hồ Chí Minh, declared Vietnamese independence, but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina.

Their debut album \"Spice\" (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history.

The subject is the main entity in the sentence, the predicate is the relationship between the subject and the object, and the object is the entity that is related to the subject. The triples are extracted based on the following rules: - The subject is the main entity in the sentence, which is usually the noun phrase. - The predicate is the relationship between the subject and the object, which is usually a verb or a preposition. - The object is the entity that is related to the subject, which is usually a noun phrase. - If there are multiple objects, they are considered as separate triples. - If there are multiple predicates, they are considered as separate triples. - If there are multiple subjects, they are considered as separate triples.  Note that the triples are extracted based on the context of the sentence, so the triples may not be accurate if the sentence is ambiguous or if the context is unclear.  Also, the triples are in the format of [[subject, predicate, object]], which is a list of lists. The triples are returned as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a triple.

Toyah!\"'].\n\nHere is a Python function to solve this problem. This function uses regular expressions to extract the information and create the triples.\n\n```Python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_triples(text):\n    triples = []\n    pattern = re.compile(r'(\\w+)(?:\\s*,\\s*)?(?:\\s*:\\s*)?(\\w+)(?:\\s*,\\s*)?(?:\\s*:\\s*)?(\\w+)')\n    matches = pattern.finditer(text)\n    for match in matches:\n        subject, predicate, obj = match.groups()\n        triples.append([subject, predicate, obj])\n    return triples\n```\n\nYou can use this function to extract triples from the text. For example:\n\n```Python\ntext = \"The Amazon River flows through Brazil and Peru.\"\ntriples = extract_triples(text)\nprint(triples)  # Output: [['Amazon River', 'flows through', 'Brazil and Peru.']]\n```\n\nNote that the function assumes that the text is in a simple format where the subject, predicate, and object are separated by spaces. It also assumes that the object is a single word or phrase. If the text is more complex, you may need to adjust the regular expression or add additional processing steps. For example, if the text includes quotes or parentheses, you may need to adjust the regular expression to handle these characters correctly. \n\nAlso note that the function does not perform any semantic analysis or disambiguation. It simply extracts the first three words it finds and treats them as a triple. In some cases, this may not produce the most accurate results. For example, if the text includes multiple instances of the same word, the function may extract multiple triples with the same subject. If you need to extract triples from text in a more sophisticated way, you may want to consider using a natural language processing library or tool. "

Text: William Penn (14 October 1644 – 30 July 1718) was an English writer and religious thinker belonging to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, a North American colony of England. He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed. Philadelphia was planned out to be grid-like with its streets and be very easy to navigate, unlike London where Penn was from. The streets are named with numbers and tree names. He chose to use the names of trees for the cross streets because Pennsylvania means \"Penn's Woods\". Your answer: ",

Triples: [['Amazon River', 'country', 'Brazil'], ['Amazon River', 'country', 'Peru']]. Text: This is a list of Florida death metal bands. Death metal is a genre of extreme heavy metal music that is characterized by musically by fast, distorted, down-tuned, and sometimes palm-muted guitar instrumentation, growled and screamed vocals, and hyper-fast, blast beat drumming. The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre. The scene declined in the second half of the 1990s but subsequently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Obituary, and Death collectively sold over five-million albums. Your answer: ",

Each triple is a list containing the subject, predicate, and object. The subject is the first word of the sentence, the predicate is the second word, and the object is the rest of the sentence. The function uses various techniques to extract the subject, predicate, and object from the sentence, including removing punctuation, quotes, and parentheses. It also handles cases where the subject, predicate, or object is a phrase rather than a single word. The function returns the list of triples as a json object. Here is an example of how to use this function:\n```\ntext = \"The Amazon River flows through Brazil and Peru.\"\ntriples = extract_triples(text)\nprint(triples)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\n[['Amazon River', 'flows through',"

Text: Confederate Ireland was the period of Irish Catholic self-government between 1642 and 1649, during the Eleven Years' War. During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press.

Text: Dip Top Peak is a 7,291-foot-elevation (2,222 meter) mountain summit located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in eastern King County of Washington state. It is part of the Cascade Range and is set on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The peak is situated north of Mount Daniel, and less than one mile south of Jade Lake. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into East Fork Foss River, which is a tributary of the Skykomish River. The summit saddle has two rock horns, of which the higher southwest peak is the true summit. The first ascent was made August 1950 by Bill and Gene Prater. In the early 1970s, brothers Gene and Bill Prater created the modern aluminum snowshoe known today, and sold them via Bill's \"Sherpa Snowshoes\" company, which proved very popular. Your answer: ",

Text: The Empire of Trebizond, or Trapezuntine Empire, was a monarchy and one of three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Laskaris and later with the Palaiologos dynasties, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors. Your answer: ",

Text: Despite the obstacles, readers and commentators have reached a broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle.

For example, 'GBA' is considered as a 'handheld game console' because it is mentioned as a 32-bit handheld game console in the text. 'GBA' is also considered as the'successor' of 'Game Boy Color' because it is mentioned as the successor to the Game Boy Color in the text. Similarly, 'GBA' is considered as the'release date' of the mentioned dates because it is mentioned as the release date in the text.  The triples are generated based on the context of the text, not based on the specific format of the text. For example, the text does not mention 'GBA' as a 'country', so there is no triple like ['GBA', 'country', 'Brazil'].  Please note that this is a simple example, and the actual triples may be more complex and nuanced. You can use natural language processing techniques, such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing, to generate the triples. You can also use machine learning algorithms, such as supervised learning, to train a model to generate the triples.
