In the early 1980s, Lechia won the Polish Cup, the Polish SuperCup, and played in a European competition for the first time. After having two mergers with other teams in the 1990s the club had to restart from the sixth tier in 2001.

Text: Despite struggling in the 1880s and 1890s, the Pirates were among the best teams in baseball shortly after the turn of the 20th century. They won three NL titles from 1901 to 1903, played in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and won their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They also won the 1971 World Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \"We Are Family\", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell. After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s, the Pirates struggled mightily over the following decades with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in American professional sports history. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2013 and advanced to the NLDS. The team qualified for the postseason again in 2014 and 2015. The Pirates currently have the sixth-longest World Series championship drought (behind the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Mariners—all except the Indians have never won a World Series), second-longest World Series appearance drought in Major League Baseball (behind only the Mariners, who have never appeared in a World Series), the longest pennant drought in the National League (their most recent showing being their victory in the 1979 World Series), and the longest League Championship Series appearance drought in either league.

Text: Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal, FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed.

Two more entities were incorporated into the union: the Laotian protectorate and the Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan. The French exploited the resources in the region during their rule, but also contributed to improvements of the health and education system in the region. Nevertheless, deep divides remained between the natives and the colonists, leading to sporadic rebellions by the former. After the Fall of France during World War II, the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945, when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime. After the Japanese surrender, the Viet Minh, a communist organization led by Hồ Chí Minh, declared Vietnamese independence, but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina.

The group comprises Melanie Brown, also known as Mel B (\"Scary Spice\"), Melanie Chisholm, or Mel C (\"Sporty Spice\"), Emma Bunton (\"Baby Spice\"), Geri Halliwell (\"Ginger Spice\"), and Victoria Beckham (\"Posh Spice\"). In 1996, \"Top of the Pops\" magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. With their \"girl power\" mantra, the Spice Girls redefined the girl group concept by targeting a young female fanbase instead of a male audience. They led the teen pop resurgence of the 1990s and became pop culture icons of the decade. They are cited as part of the Second British Invasion of the United States and were \"arguably the most recognizable face\" of Cool Britannia, the mid-1990s celebration of youth culture in the United Kingdom.

Text: The Spice Girls were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \"Wannabe\" in 1996; it hit number one in 37 countries and commenced their global success. Their debut album \"Spice\" (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Their follow-up album, \"Spiceworld\" (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 14 million copies worldwide. Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and consistent lyrical theme of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the five members. In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, \"Forever\", was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting. Since then, the group have reunited for two concert tours, the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019), both of which won the \"Billboard\" Live Music Award for the highest-grossing engagements of their respective years.

Text: In 1681, King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn's father, the admiral and politician Sir William Penn. This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil, sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, (past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies) in New Castle (now in Delaware) in 1682. On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor, and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held. Afterward, Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia, on the west bank. However, Penn's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch, Swedish colonists, and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware, but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland's proprietor family, the Calverts and Lord Baltimore. These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a \"Pennsylvania\", so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly. Twenty-three years later in 1704, they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware, were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential settlement in the new colony, New Castle, the original Swedish colony town became the capital. Your answer: ",

Text: In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the \"defensive\" team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Your answer: ",

Death metal is a genre of extreme heavy metal music that is characterized by musically by fast, distorted, down-tuned, and sometimes palm-muted guitar instrumentation, growled and screamed vocals, and hyper-fast, blast beat drumming. The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre. The scene declined in the second half of the 1990s but subsequently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Obituary, and Death collectively sold over five-million albums. Your answer: ",

Text: Confederate Ireland was the period of Irish Catholic self-government between 1642 and 1649, during the Eleven Years' War. During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press. Confederate ambassadors were appointed and recognised in France, Spain and the Papal States, who supplied the Confederates with money and weapons. Your answer: ",

The summit saddle has two rock horns, of which the higher southwest peak is the true summit. The first ascent was made August 1950 by Bill and Gene Prater.

The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Laskaris and later with the Palaiologos dynasties, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors. Your answer: ",

Text: Despite the obstacles, readers and commentators have reached a broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text \"La Scienza Nuova\" (The New Science), upon which they argue \"Finnegans Wake\" is structured.

She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released eight studio albums, and hosted her own Emmy-nominated television series, \"The Judy Garland Show\" (1963–1964).

In this adaptation, Dracula is the monster alter ego of historical figure Vlad III \"the Impaler\" Drăculea. Luke Evans portrays the title character, with Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson, and Charles Dance cast in supporting roles.
