This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of illegitimate conception is repeated in Arthur's siring of Mordred by his own half-sister Morgause in the 13th century French prose cycles, which was invented by them; it is Mordred who mortally wounds King Arthur in the Battle of Camlann.

Let's use an example:\nText: Chevrolet ( ), colloquially referred to as Chevy and formally the Chevrolet Division of General Motors Company, is an American automobile division of the American manufacturer General Motors (GM). Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3, 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918, and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International.

The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and first appeared in the comic book \"Action Comics\" #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18, 1938).

In 2007, the manga was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Tokyopop. A 24-episode anime series created by Studio Deen aired in Japan between January and June 2006. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the television series and re-released the series on DVD and for the first time on Blu-ray Disc. A film adaptation by Studio Deen was released in Japanese theaters on January 23, 2010. A second anime television series, \"Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works\", was produced by Ufotable and aired between October 2014 and June 2015, following the game's second route as opposed to the first. A second manga adaptation began in 2015 focusing solely on the third route. A film trilogy adapted the Heaven's Feel route of the visual novel, with the first film, titled \"presage flower\", released in 2017, the second film, titled \"lost butterfly\", released in 2019, and the final film, titled \"spring song\" released in late 2020 after postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Chevrolet', 'American automobile', 'General Motors', 'Louis Chevrolet', 'William C. Durant', 'November 3, 1911', 'reverse merger', 'May 2, 1918', '1919', 'Alfred Sloan', 'maxim', 'Henry Ford', 'Model T', 'Ford', 'United States', '1929', 'Chevrolet International'] What do you know about the entities? ['Reverse merger is a/an concept.', '1919 is a/an date.', 'Maxim is a/an concept.', '1929 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['owned by', 'founded by', 'inception', 'manufacturer', 'country'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Model T', 'Manufacturer', 'Ford'], ['Chevrolet', 'Inception', 'November 3, 1911'], ['Ford', 'Country', 'United States'], ['Chevrolet', 'founded by', 'William C.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Henry Ford', 'inception', 'Alfred Sloan'], ['1929', 'country', 'Louis Chevrolet']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - inception - does not hold between Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan.', 'The relation - country - does not hold between 1929 and Louis Chevrolet.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Chevrolet', 'Owned by', 'General Motors'], ['Chevrolet', 'Founded by', 'Louis Chevrolet'], ['Chevrolet', 'founded by', 'William C. Durant'], ['Chevrolet', 'Inception', 'November 3, 1911'], ['Model T', 'Manufacturer', 'Ford'], ['Ford', 'Country', 'United States']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples.

The club was founded in 1945 by people expelled from Lwów, who were supporters of Poland's oldest football team Lechia Lwów, founded in 1903. The club's name comes from Lechia, a poetic name for Poland, and is a continuation of the name used by the club based in Lwów. In their early years, Lechia enjoyed some success, most notably finishing third in the Polish top division, before spending decades in the second and third tiers. In the early 1980s, Lechia won the Polish Cup, the Polish SuperCup, and played in a European competition for the first time. After having two mergers with other teams in the 1990s the club had to restart from the sixth tier in 2001. In May 2008 the club was promoted again to the Ekstraklasa, with the club's most recent success coming in 2019, finishing third in the league and again winning both the Polish Cup and SuperCup.

The human impact on modern-era Earth and its ecosystems may be considered of global significance for the future evolution of living species, including approximately synchronous lithospheric evidence, or more recently hydrospheric and atmospheric evidence of the human impact. In July 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences split the Holocene epoch into three distinct subsections, Greenlandian (11,700 years ago to 8,200 years ago), Northgrippian (8,200 years ago to 4,200 years ago) and Meghalayan (4,200 years ago to the present), as proposed by International Commission on Stratigraphy.

Let's use an example:\nText: Dana Elaine Owens (born March 18, 1970), known professionally as Queen Latifah, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, actress, and producer. Born in Newark, New Jersey, she signed with Tommy Boy Records in 1989 and released her debut album \"All Hail the Queen\" on November 28, 1989, featuring the hit single \"Ladies First\". \"Nature of a Sista'\" (1991) was her second and final album with Tommy Boy Records.

Text: Despite struggling in the 1880s and 1890s, the Pirates were among the best teams in baseball shortly after the turn of the 20th century. They won three NL titles from 1901 to 1903, played in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and won their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They also won the 1971 World Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \"We Are Family\", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell. After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s, the Pirates struggled mightily over the following decades with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in American professional sports history. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2013 and advanced to the NLDS. The team qualified for the postseason again in 2014 and 2015. The Pirates currently have the sixth-longest World Series championship drought (behind the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Mariners—all except the Indians have never won a World Series), second-longest World Series appearance drought in Major League Baseball (behind only the Mariners, who have never appeared in a World Series), the longest pennant drought in the National League (their most recent showing being their victory in the 1979 World Series), and the longest League Championship Series appearance drought in either league.

Text: The 747 is a quadjet, initially powered by JT9D turbofan engines, then GE CF6 and Rolls-Royce RB211 engines for the original variants. With a ten-abreast economy seating, it typically accommodates 366 passengers in three travel classes. It has a pronounced 37.5° wing sweep, allowing a cruise speed, and its heavy weight is supported by four main landing gear legs with four-wheel bogies each. The partial double-deck aircraft was designed with a raised cockpit so it could be converted to a freighter airplane by installing a front cargo door, as it was initially thought that it would eventually be superseded by supersonic transports.

Text: Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal, FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed.

In the late sixth century BC, the area was subjugated by the Persian Achaemenid Empire, then incorporated into the kingdom of Macedonia in the fourth century BC. The Romans conquered the region in the second century BC and made it part of the larger province of Macedonia. The area remained part of the Byzantine Empire, but was often raided and settled by Slavic tribes beginning in the sixth century of the Christian era. Following centuries of contention between the Bulgarian, Byzantine, and Serbian Empire, it was part of the Ottoman dominion from the mid-14th until the early 20th century, when, following the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, the modern territory of North Macedonia came under Serbian rule.

Text: The French annexed Cochinchina and established a protectorate in Cambodia in 1862 and 1863 respectively. After the French took over northern Vietnam through the Tonkin campaign, the various protectorates were consolidated into one union in 1887. Two more entities were incorporated into the union: the Laotian protectorate and the Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan. The French exploited the resources in the region during their rule, but also contributed to improvements of the health and education system in the region. Nevertheless, deep divides remained between the natives and the colonists, leading to sporadic rebellions by the former. After the Fall of France during World War II, the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945, when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime. After the Japanese surrender, the Viet Minh, a communist organization led by Hồ Chí Minh, declared Vietnamese independence, but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina.

In 1996, \"Top of the Pops\" magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. With their \"girl power\" mantra, the Spice Girls redefined the girl group concept by targeting a young female fanbase instead of a male audience. They led the teen pop resurgence of the 1990s and became pop culture icons of the decade. They are cited as part of the Second British Invasion of the United States and were \"arguably the most recognizable face\" of Cool Britannia, the mid-1990s celebration of youth culture in the United Kingdom.

Their debut album \"Spice\" (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Their follow-up album, \"Spiceworld\" (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 14 million copies worldwide. Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and consistent lyrical theme of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the five members. In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, \"Forever\", was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting. Since then, the group have reunited for two concert tours, the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019), both of which won the \"Billboard\" Live Music Award for the highest-grossing engagements of their respective years.

['Philosophical is a/an concept.', 'Novel is a/an concept.', 'Novella is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['author', 'notable work', 'genre'] Let's make a draft of the triples.

The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['July 1890', 'author', 'philosophical'], ['April 1891', 'genre', \"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\"]]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - author - does not hold between July 1890 and philosophical.', \"The relation - genre - does not hold between April 1891 and Lippincott's Monthly Magazine.\"] Therefore, final triples should be: [['The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Author', 'Oscar Wilde'], ['Oscar Wilde', 'Notable work', 'The Picture of Dorian Gray'], ['Oscar Wilde', 'Genre', 'novel']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Animal Farm is a satirical allegorical novella by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945. The book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, the rebellion is betrayed, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon. Your answer: ",

Her 1984 multi-platinum album, \"Private Dancer\" contained her hit song \"What's Love Got to Do with It\", which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, and it became her first and only No.1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. At age 44, she was the oldest female solo artist to top the Hot 100. Her chart success continued with \"Better Be Good to Me\", \"Private Dancer\", \"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\", \"Typical Male\", \"The Best\", \"I Don't Wanna Fight\", and \"GoldenEye\". During her Break Every Rule World Tour in 1988, she set a then-Guinness World Record for the largest paying audience (180,000) for a solo performer. Turner also acted in the films \"Tommy\" (1975), \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" (1985), and \"Last Action Hero\" (1993). In 1993, \"What's Love Got to Do with It\", a biopic adapted from her autobiography \"I, Tina: My Life Story\", was released.

Text: William Penn (14 October 1644 – 30 July 1718) was an English writer and religious thinker belonging to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, a North American colony of England. He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed. Philadelphia was planned out to be grid-like with its streets and be very easy to navigate, unlike London where Penn was from. The streets are named with numbers and tree names. He chose to use the names of trees for the cross streets because Pennsylvania means \"Penn's Woods\". Your answer: ",

Text: In 1681, King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn's father, the admiral and politician Sir William Penn. This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil, sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, (past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies) in New Castle (now in Delaware) in 1682. On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor, and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held. Afterward, Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia, on the west bank. However, Penn's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch, Swedish colonists, and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware, but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland's proprietor family, the Calverts and Lord Baltimore. These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a \"Pennsylvania\", so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly. Twenty-three years later in 1704, they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware, were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential settlement in the new colony, New Castle, the original Swedish colony town became the capital. Your answer: ",

However, an international forensic test conducted in 2013 rejected allegations that he was poisoned. It was concluded that he was suffering from prostate cancer.

Text: In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the \"defensive\" team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Your answer: ",

In 1796, shortly before the end of his second term as U.S. President, George Washington endowed the struggling academy with a gift of stock, one of the largest gifts to an educational institution at that time. In gratitude, the school was renamed for Washington, the commander of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, president at the 1787 Federal Constitutional Convention, and first President of the United States. In 1865, shortly after his April 9 surrender to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Armies, former Confederate States Army general-in-chief Robert E. Lee (1807–1870) served as president of the college for five years until his death in 1870, when the college was thereafter renamed the \"Washington and Lee University.\" One of the oldest institutions of higher education in the American South, W&L is the second-oldest in the Commonwealth of Virginia (next to the College of William & Mary, founded in 1693).

Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: This is a list of Florida death metal bands. Death metal is a genre of extreme heavy metal music that is characterized by musically by fast, distorted, down-tuned, and sometimes palm-muted guitar instrumentation, growled and screamed vocals, and hyper-fast, blast beat drumming. The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre. The scene declined in the second half of the 1990s but subsequently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Obituary, and Death collectively sold over five-million albums. Your answer: ",

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: The narrative takes as its literal subject the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward, and describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven. Allegorically the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (\"Inferno\"), followed by the penitent Christian life (\"Purgatorio\"), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (\"Paradiso\"). Dante draws on medieval Roman Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the \"Summa Theologica\" of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the \"Divine Comedy\" has been called \"the \"Summa\" in verse\". In Dante's work, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil (who represents human reason), Beatrice (who represents divine revelation, theology, faith, and grace), and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother). Erich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues; this along with the fully imagined world of the \"Divine Comedy\", different from our own but fully visualized, suggests that the \"Divine Comedy\" could be said to have inaugurated realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction.

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Superman is a superhero character who first appeared in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and first appeared in the comic book \"Action Comics\" #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18, 1938). Superman has been adapted to a number of other media which includes radio serials, novels, movies, television shows and theatre. Let's extract the entities first.

['Superhero is a/an concept.', '\"action comics\" #1 is a/an media.', '1 is a/an number.', 'Cover-date is a/an unknown.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['occupation'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Jerry Siegel', 'occupation', 'DC Comics'], ['Superman', 'Occupation', 'superhero'], ['superhero', 'occupation', 'superhero']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Jerry Siegel', 'occupation', 'DC Comics'], ['superhero', 'occupation', 'superhero']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - occupation - does not hold between Jerry Siegel and DC Comics.', 'The relation - occupation - does not hold between superhero and superhero.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Superman', 'Occupation', 'superhero']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Shaun Tan (born 1974) is an Australian artist, writer and film maker.

Starring Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, and Dax Shepard, it follows an American soldier who takes part in a classified hibernation experiment, only to be accidentally frozen for too long and awaken 500 years later in a dystopian world where dysgenics and commercialism have run rampant, mankind has embraced anti-intellectualism, and society is devoid of such traits as intellectual curiosity, social responsibility, justice, and human rights. The film was not screened for critics, and the distributor, 20th Century Fox, was accused of abandoning it.

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Chevrolet ( ), colloquially referred to as Chevy and formally the Chevrolet Division of General Motors Company, is an American automobile division of the American manufacturer General Motors (GM). Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3, 1911 as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918, and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose\", would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929 with the Chevrolet International. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Chevrolet', 'American automobile', 'General Motors', 'Louis Chevrolet', 'William C.

The city's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia. When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline. At the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul. In the 1940s it lost its main access to the sea, Antakya and İskenderun, also to Turkey. The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation. This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. It won the title of the \"Islamic Capital of Culture 2006\", and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks. The Battle of Aleppo (2012–2016) occurred in the city during the Syrian Civil War, and many parts of the city suffered massive destruction.

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

It was founded as the Augusta Academy (later renamed Liberty Hall Academy) by Scots-Irish Presbyterian pioneers, though the university has never claimed any sectarian affiliation. In 1796, shortly before the end of his second term as U.S. President, George Washington endowed the struggling academy with a gift of stock, one of the largest gifts to an educational institution at that time. In gratitude, the school was renamed for Washington, the commander of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, president at the 1787 Federal Constitutional Convention, and first President of the United States. In 1865, shortly after his April 9 surrender to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Armies, former Confederate States Army general-in-chief Robert E. Lee (1807–1870) served as president of the college for five years until his death in 1870, when the college was thereafter renamed the \"Washington and Lee University.\" One of the oldest institutions of higher education in the American South, W&L is the second-oldest in the Commonwealth of Virginia (next to the College of William & Mary, founded in 1693).

Text: Confederate Ireland was the period of Irish Catholic self-government between 1642 and 1649, during the Eleven Years' War. During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press. Confederate ambassadors were appointed and recognised in France, Spain and the Papal States, who supplied the Confederates with money and weapons. Your answer: ",

Text: Better Call Saul is an American crime drama television series created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. It is a spin-off, prequel, and a sequel of Gilligan's previous series, \"Breaking Bad\". Set in the early to mid-2000s in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series develops Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), an earnest lawyer and former con-man, into a greedy criminal defense attorney known as Saul Goodman. Also shown is the moral decline of retired police officer Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), who becomes closely affiliated with the Juarez drug cartel to support his granddaughter and her widowed mother. Jimmy and Mike's interactions remain sporadic until their respective storylines fully converge. The show premiered on AMC on February 8, 2015, airing five seasons to date. A sixth and final season, consisting of 13 episodes, is set to premiere in early 2022. Your answer: ",

Text: The Empire of Trebizond, or Trapezuntine Empire, was a monarchy and one of three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes.

Let's use an example:\nText: Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports drama film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. The film co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Burt Young, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki. \"Rocky IV\" was the highest-grossing sports movie of all time for 24 years, before it was overtaken by \"The Blind Side\". It is the sequel to the 1982 film \"Rocky III\" and it is the most financially successful installment in the \"Rocky\" franchise. Let's extract the entities first.

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

The notoriety of the tale is such that Merriam-Webster gives the word \"Bluebeard\" the definition of \"a man who marries and kills one wife after another,\" and the verb \"bluebearding\" has even appeared as a way to describe the crime of either killing a series of women, or seducing and abandoning a series of women. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Bluebeard', 'folktale', 'Charles Perrault', '1697', 'Histoires ou contes du temps passé', 'The White Dove', 'The Robber Bridegroom', \"Fitcher's Bird\", 'Merriam-Webster'] What do you know about the entities? ['Folktale is a/an concept.', '1697 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['author', 'notable work'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Bluebeard', 'Author', 'Charles Perrault'], ['Charles Perrault', 'Notable work', 'Histoires ou contes du temps passé'], ['Histoires ou contes du temps passé', 'author', 'Charles Perrault'], ['Charles Perrault', 'author', 'The White Dove'], ['The White Dove', 'notable work', 'folktale']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Charles Perrault', 'author', 'The White Dove'], ['The White Dove', 'notable work', 'folktale']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - author - does not hold between Charles Perrault and The White Dove.', 'The relation - notable work - does not hold between The White Dove and folktale.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Bluebeard', 'Author', 'Charles Perrault'], ['Charles Perrault', 'Notable work', 'Histoires ou contes du temps passé'], ['Histoires ou contes du temps passé', 'author', 'Charles Perrault']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his \"Pentamerone\" in 1634; the version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\" in 1697.

Coming full circle, Ziff Davis acquired IGN Entertainment as a whole in February 2013, re-uniting \"1Up.com\" with its original owners. Shortly after the acquisition, however, Ziff Davis announced that in an effort to concentrate on IGN, it would shut down most of its secondary sites, including \"1Up.com\".

Coming full circle, Ziff Davis acquired IGN Entertainment as a whole in February 2013, re-uniting \"1Up.com\" with its original owners. Shortly after the acquisition, however, Ziff Davis announced that in an effort to concentrate on IGN, it would shut down most of its secondary sites, including \"1Up.com\".

Text: Despite the obstacles, readers and commentators have reached a broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text \"La Scienza Nuova\" (The New Science), upon which they argue \"Finnegans Wake\" is structured.

Its politics were deeply influenced by the French, who supported no fewer than three \"coups d'état\" to bring the different political factions to power that France favored at different moments in its own political development.

First released in South Korea on May 28, 2014, it is a successor to 2013's LG G2. Inheriting design elements from the G2, such as its thin screen bezels and rear-mounted power and volume buttons, the G3 is distinguished primarily by being the first smartphone from a major manufacturer to incorporate a 1440p display, and its inclusion of an infrared hybrid autofocus system for its camera. LG also touted the device's plastic \"metallic skin\"—designed to give the device a higher quality appearance, and a \"simpler\" user interface with an integrated intelligent personal assistant system. The battery can be quickly changed by the user, allowing charged spare batteries to be carried. Your answer: ",

She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released eight studio albums, and hosted her own Emmy-nominated television series, \"The Judy Garland Show\" (1963–1964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

The Miracle, the club's previous moniker, originated that year in Orlando, Florida, as the sister team to the NBA's Orlando Magic. Financial straits left the Miracle teetering on the brink of disbanding before the Mohegan Indian tribe purchased and relocated the team to Mohegan Sun, becoming the first Native American tribe to own a professional sports franchise.

After the start of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), the OUN-B in the person of Yaroslav Stetsko declared an independent Ukrainian state on 30 June 1941 in occupied Lviv, while the region was under the control of Nazi Germany, pledging loyalty to Adolf Hitler. In response, the Nazi authorities suppressed the OUN leadership. In October 1942 the OUN-B established the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA).

        "prompt": "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use an example:\nText: Necochea is a port and beach city in the southwest of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The city is located on the Atlantic coast, along the mouth of the Quequén Grande River, from Buenos Aires and southwest of Mar del Plata. The city proper has 90,000 inhabitants per the and is the seat of government for Necochea Partido. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Necochea', 'Buenos Aires Province', 'Atlantic', 'Quequén Grande River', 'Buenos Aires', 'Mar del Plata', 'seat of government', 'Necochea Partido'] What do you know about the entities? ['Seat of government is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['location', 'mouth of the watercourse', 'capital'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Quequén Grande River', 'Mouth of the watercourse', 'Atlantic'], ['Atlantic', 'location', 'Necochea'], ['Necochea Partido', 'Capital', 'Necochea'], ['Necochea', 'Location', 'Necochea Partido'], ['seat of government', 'capital', 'Mar del Plata']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Atlantic', 'location', 'Necochea'], ['seat of government', 'capital', 'Mar del Plata']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - location - does not hold between Atlantic and Necochea.', 'The relation - capital - does not hold between seat of government and Mar del Plata.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Necochea', 'Location', 'Necochea Partido'], ['Quequén Grande River', 'Mouth of the watercourse', 'Atlantic'], ['Necochea Partido', 'Capital', 'Necochea']] \nThink like a domain expert and check the validity of the triples. Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Located on the Brunswick Peninsula north of the Strait of Magellan, Punta Arenas was originally established by the Chilean government in 1848 as a tiny penal colony to assert sovereignty over the Strait. During the remainder of the 1800s, Punta Arenas grew in size and importance due to the increasing maritime traffic and trade travelling to the west coasts of South and North America. This period of growth also resulted from the waves of European immigrants, mainly from Croatia and Russia attracted to the gold rush and sheep farming boom in the 1880s and early 1900s. The largest sheep company, controlling 10,000 square kilometres in Chile and Argentina, was based in Punta Arenas, and its owners lived there. Your answer: ",
        "extraction": "First, let's identify the entities in the text: ['Brunswick Peninsula', 'Strait of Magellan', 'Punta Arenas', 'Chilean government', 'sovereignty', 'maritime traffic', 'trade', 'west coasts of South and North America', 'European immigrants', 'Croatia', 'Russia', 'gold rush', 'sheep farming boom', '1880s and early 1900s', 'largest sheep company', '10,000 square kilometres', 'Chile', 'Argentina'] \n\nWhat do we know about the entities? ['Sovereignty is a/an concept.', 'Maritime traffic is a/an concept.', 'Trade is a/an concept.', 'Gold rush is a/an historical event.', 'Sheep farming boom is a/an historical event.']\n\nPotential relations between these entities could be: ['location', 'established by', 'assert', 'growth due to', 'attraction', 'based in', 'ownership']\n\nDrafting the triples, we get: [['Punta Arenas', 'location', 'Brunswick Peninsula'], ['Punta Arenas', 'established by', 'Chilean government'], ['Chilean government', 'assert', 'sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan'], ['Punta Arenas', 'growth due to', 'maritime traffic and trade'], ['Punta Arenas', 'attraction', 'European immigrants'], ['largest sheep company', 'based in', 'Punta Arenas'], ['largest sheep company', 'ownership', '10,000 square kilometres in Chile and Argentina']]\n\nChecking for incorrect triples, we find none. All the triples seem to accurately represent the relations between the entities.\n\nTherefore, the final triples are: [['Punta Arenas', 'location', 'Brunswick Peninsula'], ['Punta Arenas', 'established by', 'Chilean government'], ['Chilean government', 'assert', 'sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan'], ['Punta Arenas', 'growth due to', 'maritime traffic and trade'], ['Punta Arenas', 'attraction', 'European immigrants'], ['largest sheep company', 'based in', 'Punta Arenas'], ['largest sheep company', 'ownership', '10,000 square kilometres in Chile and Argentina']]",
