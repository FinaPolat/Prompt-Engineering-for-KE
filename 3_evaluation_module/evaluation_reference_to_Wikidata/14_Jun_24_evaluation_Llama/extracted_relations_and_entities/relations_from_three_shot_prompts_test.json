It also does not account for cases where the text is not in English.  The text can be any length and can contain multiple sentences.  The triples will be returned in a list of lists, where each sublist is a triple in the format [subject, predicate, object].  The subject, predicate, and object can be any string, but they should be in the format of a valid triple (i.e., the subject and object should not be the same).  If a triple cannot be extracted from the text, it will not be included in the output.  If there are multiple possible extractions for a triple, all of them will be included in the output.  For example, if the text is \"The book is on the table and the book is on the shelf.\", the output will include the triples [['book",

    [
        "used on','smart TVs']]  The input text is a string. The output should be a list of lists, where each inner list is a triple in the form [subject, predicate, object].  The subject, predicate, and object are all strings. The triples are extracted using named entity recognition and dependency parsing. The subject is the named entity, the predicate is the relation between the subject and the object, and the object is the named entity or a phrase that describes the subject. For example, in the text \"The Amazon River flows through Brazil and Peru\", \"Amazon River\" is the subject, \"flows through\" is the predicate, and \"Brazil and Peru\" is the object. In the text \"COVID-19 symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath\", \"COVID-19\" is the subject, \"symptoms\" is the predicate, and \"fever, cough, and shortness of breath\" is the object.  The triples are extracted from the dependency parse tree of the sentence. The subject is the head of the dependency tree, the predicate is the relation between the subject and the object, and the object is the child of the subject in the dependency tree. For example, in the text \"The Amazon River flows through Brazil and Peru\", the dependency parse tree is:  (S  (NP The Amazon River)  (VP flows  (PP through  (NP Brazil and Peru)))) The subject is \"The Amazon River\", the predicate is \"flows through\", and the object is \"Brazil and Peru\".  The triples are extracted by traversing the dependency tree and identifying the subject, predicate, and object.  The triples are returned in json format.  The json format is a list of lists, where each inner list is a triple in the form [subject, predicate, object].  For example, the triples [['Amazon River",
