Text: According to Arthurian legend, Merlin magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy Gorlois, enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois' wife Lady Igraine. Thus Arthur, \"the once and future king\", is an illegitimate child (though later legend, as found in Malory, emphasises that the conception occurred after Gorlois's death and that he was legitimated by Uther's subsequent marriage to Igraine). This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of illegitimate conception is repeated in Arthur's siring of Mordred by his own half-sister Morgause in the 13th century French prose cycles, which was invented by them; it is Mordred who mortally wounds King Arthur in the Battle of Camlann.

The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution, in which they worshipped one god only, Aten, or the sun disc. With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history. Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband's death and before the ascension of Tutankhamun, although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate. If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes. Your answer: ",

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

Text: Despite struggling in the 1880s and 1890s, the Pirates were among the best teams in baseball shortly after the turn of the 20th century. They won three NL titles from 1901 to 1903, played in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and won their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They also won the 1971 World Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \"We Are Family\", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell. After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s, the Pirates struggled mightily over the following decades with 20 consecutive losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in American professional sports history. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2013 and advanced to the NLDS. The team qualified for the postseason again in 2014 and 2015. The Pirates currently have the sixth-longest World Series championship drought (behind the Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Mariners—all except the Indians have never won a World Series), second-longest World Series appearance drought in Major League Baseball (behind only the Mariners, who have never appeared in a World Series), the longest pennant drought in the National League (their most recent showing being their victory in the 1979 World Series), and the longest League Championship Series appearance drought in either league. From 1882 to 2020, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,564–10,446 ( winning 'percentage') Your answer: ",

Text: Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who were launching a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well. Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini. In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal, FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and Eckert. Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed.

While in Paris during the 1940s, he joined the French Communist Party. Returning to Cambodia in 1953, he involved himself in the Marxist–Leninist Khmer Việt Minh organisation and its guerrilla war against King Norodom Sihanouk's newly independent government. Following the Khmer Việt Minh's 1954 retreat into Marxist–Leninist controlled North Vietnam, Pol Pot returned to Phnom Penh, working as a teacher while remaining a central member of Cambodia's Marxist–Leninist movement. In 1959, he helped formalise the movement into the Kampuchean Labour Party, which was later renamed the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). To avoid state repression, in 1962 he relocated to a jungle encampment and in 1963 became the CPK's leader. In 1968, he relaunched the war against Sihanouk's government. After Lon Nol ousted Sihanouk in a 1970 coup, Pol Pot's forces sided with the deposed leader against the new government, which was bolstered by the United States military.

After the French took over northern Vietnam through the Tonkin campaign, the various protectorates were consolidated into one union in 1887. Two more entities were incorporated into the union: the Laotian protectorate and the Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan. The French exploited the resources in the region during their rule, but also contributed to improvements of the health and education system in the region. Nevertheless, deep divides remained between the natives and the colonists, leading to sporadic rebellions by the former. After the Fall of France during World War II, the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945, when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime. After the Japanese surrender, the Viet Minh, a communist organization led by Hồ Chí Minh, declared Vietnamese independence, but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina.

There is no singularly accepted scope for the region, and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of Mauritania in the west, to Egypt's Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the east. Varying sources have limited it to the countries of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia, a region that was known by the French during colonial times as \"Afrique du Nord\" and is known by Arabs as the Maghreb (\"West\", \"The western part of Arab World\"). The most commonly accepted definition includes Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Sudan, the 6 countries that shape the top North of the African continent.

The term is used mostly by Greeks and is associated with the existence of a substantial ethnic Greek population in the region. It also has connotations with political claims on the territory on the grounds that it was held by Greece and in 1914 was declared an independent state by the local Greeks against annexation to the newly founded Albanian principality.

Text: Samaria (; , ', \"Šōmərôn\"; , ' – also known as \"\", \"Nablus Mountains\") is a historical and biblical name used for the central region of the ancient Land of Israel, bordered by Galilee to the north and Judaea to the south. For the beginning of the Common Era, Josephus set the Mediterranean Sea as its limit to the west, and the Jordan River as its limit to the east. Its territory largely corresponds to the biblical allotments of the tribe of Ephraim and the western half of Manasseh; after the death of Solomon and the splitting-up of his empire into the southern Kingdom of Judah and the northern Kingdom of Israel, this territory constituted the southern part of the Kingdom of Israel.

Their follow-up album, \"Spiceworld\" (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 14 million copies worldwide. Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and consistent lyrical theme of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the five members. In May 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, \"Forever\", was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting.

The system used VHS tape technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of \"Night Trap\" commenced. The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

Let's use a few examples:\nText: \"Romeo and Juliet\" has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical, and opera venues. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David Garrick's 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda's \"Romeo und Julie\" omitted much of the action and used a happy ending. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's, restored the original text and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th and into the 21st century, the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor's 1936 film \"Romeo and Juliet\", Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version \"Romeo and Juliet\", and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired \"Romeo + Juliet\".

Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use a few examples:\nText: \"Romeo and Juliet\" has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical, and opera venues. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David Garrick's 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda's \"Romeo und Julie\" omitted much of the action and used a happy ending. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's, restored the original text and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th and into the 21st century, the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor's 1936 film \"Romeo and Juliet\", Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version \"Romeo and Juliet\", and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired \"Romeo + Juliet\".

Text: William Penn (14 October 1644 – 30 July 1718) was an English writer and religious thinker belonging to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, a North American colony of England. He was an early advocate of democracy and religious freedom, notable for his good relations and successful treaties with the Lenape Native Americans. Under his direction, the city of Philadelphia was planned and developed. Philadelphia was planned out to be grid-like with its streets and be very easy to navigate, unlike London where Penn was from. The streets are named with numbers and tree names. He chose to use the names of trees for the cross streets because Pennsylvania means \"Penn's Woods\". Your answer: ",

Text: In 1681, King Charles II handed over a large piece of his North American land holdings along the North Atlantic Ocean coast to Penn to pay the debts the king had owed to Penn's father, the admiral and politician Sir William Penn. This land included the present-day states of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn immediately set sail and took his first step on American soil, sailing up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River, (past earlier Swedish and Dutch riverfront colonies) in New Castle (now in Delaware) in 1682. On this occasion, the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new proprietor, and the first Pennsylvania General Assembly was held. Afterward, Penn journeyed further north up the Delaware River and founded Philadelphia, on the west bank. However, Penn's Quaker government was not viewed favorably by the previous Dutch, Swedish colonists, and also earlier English settlers in what is now Delaware, but claimed for half a century by the neighboring Province of Maryland's proprietor family, the Calverts and Lord Baltimore. These earlier colonists had no historical allegiance to a \"Pennsylvania\", so they almost immediately began petitioning for their own representative assembly. Twenty-three years later in 1704, they achieved their goal when the three southernmost counties of provincial Pennsylvania along the western coast of the Delaware, were permitted to split off and become the new semi-autonomous colony of Lower Delaware. As the most prominent, prosperous and influential settlement in the new colony, New Castle, the original Swedish colony town became the capital. Your answer: ",

The system used VHS tape technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of \"Night Trap\" commenced. The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist. Your answer: ",

He is one of the most re-imagined characters in children's literature. His story has been adapted into many other media, notably the 1940 Disney film \"Pinocchio\". Collodi often used the Italian Tuscan dialect in his book. The name \"\" is a combination of the Italian words \"\" (pine), and \"occhio\" (eye); \"Pino\" is also an abbreviation of \"Giuseppino\", the diminutive for Giuseppe (the Italian form of Joseph); one of the men who greatly influenced Collodi in his youth was Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist who supervised Collodi at the \"Libreria Piatti\" bookshop in Florence.

It causes Lyme disease, also called Lyme borreliosis, a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by ticks and by lice, depending on the species of bacteria. The genus is named after French biologist Amédée Borrel (1867–1936), who first documented the distinction between a species of \"Borrelia\", \"B. anserina\", and the other known type of spirochete at the time, \"Treponema pallidum\". This bacterium must be viewed using dark-field microscopy, which make the cells appear white against a dark background. \"Borrelia\" species are grown in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium. Of 52 known species of \"Borrelia\", 21 are members of the Lyme disease group, 29 belong to the relapsing fever group, and two are members of a genetically distinct third group typically found in reptiles. The Lyme disease group has been moved to their own genus, \"Borelliella\", but this change is not yet widely accepted. This bacterium uses hard and soft ticks and lice as vectors.

Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: This is a list of Florida death metal bands. Death metal is a genre of extreme heavy metal music that is characterized by musically by fast, distorted, down-tuned, and sometimes palm-muted guitar instrumentation, growled and screamed vocals, and hyper-fast, blast beat drumming. The lyrics typically involve graphic, sometimes pornographic and misogynistic, themes of violence, gore, disease, and death; Satanism, blasphemy, and anti-Christian sentiment; and, less frequently, war, apocalypse, social and philosophical concerns, and esotericism and spiritualism. In the mid-1980s through early-1990s, the state of Florida, especially the Tampa Bay area, became the center of development for the death metal genre, earning the Tampa Bay area the colloquial title of \"capital of death metal\". Many of the most influential and commercially successful death metal bands, such as Death, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Deicide, originated from the state. The Tampa-based producers Jim and Tom Morris and Scott Burns from the studio Morrisound Recording were highly instrumental in developing and popularizing the sound of the then-emerging death metal genre. The influence and recording opportunities of the scene led a few bands from outside Florida, such as the Buffalo, New York groups Cannibal Corpse and Malevolent Creation, to relocate to the state early in their career. The technical proficiency and progressive approach by many of the Florida bands, particularly Death, Nocturnus, Atheist, and Cynic, led to the development of the progressive death metal genre. The scene declined in the second half of the 1990s but subsequently experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Obituary, and Death collectively sold over five-million albums. Your answer: ",

Let's use a few examples:\nText: The narrative takes as its literal subject the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward, and describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven. Allegorically the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (\"Inferno\"), followed by the penitent Christian life (\"Purgatorio\"), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (\"Paradiso\"). Dante draws on medieval Roman Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the \"Summa Theologica\" of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the \"Divine Comedy\" has been called \"the \"Summa\" in verse\". In Dante's work, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil (who represents human reason), Beatrice (who represents divine revelation, theology, faith, and grace), and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother). Erich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues; this along with the fully imagined world of the \"Divine Comedy\", different from our own but fully visualized, suggests that the \"Divine Comedy\" could be said to have inaugurated realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction.

Text: Idiocracy is a 2006 American dystopian science fiction comedy film directed by Mike Judge and co-written by Judge and Etan Cohen. Starring Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, and Dax Shepard, it follows an American soldier who takes part in a classified hibernation experiment, only to be accidentally frozen for too long and awaken 500 years later in a dystopian world where dysgenics and commercialism have run rampant, mankind has embraced anti-intellectualism, and society is devoid of such traits as intellectual curiosity, social responsibility, justice, and human rights. The film was not screened for critics, and the distributor, 20th Century Fox, was accused of abandoning it. Despite its lack of a major theatrical release, which resulted in a mere $495,000 gross at the box office, the film received positive reviews from critics and has become a cult film. Your answer: ",

The system used VHS tape technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of \"Night Trap\" commenced. The video footage was recorded the following year in 1987 and was followed by six months of editing and game programming. Hasbro suddenly canceled the Control-Vision in 1989, which prompted the game's executive producer, Tom Zito, to purchase the film footage and found Digital Pictures to complete its production. \"Night Trap\" was eventually released as the first interactive movie on the Sega CD in 1992, five years after filming.

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

It first appeared on a Spanish map in 1511. The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536, but later abandoned it in 1620 with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited. An English ship, the \"Olive Blossom\", arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625; its men took possession of the island in the name of King James I. In 1627, the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and Barbados became an English and later British colony. During this period, the colony operated on a plantation economy, relying on the labour of enslaved Africans which worked on the island's plantations.

During this time, two-thirds of Ireland was governed by the Irish Catholic Confederation or Confederacy, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny because it was based in Kilkenny. It was formed by Catholic nobles, landed gentry, clergy and military leaders after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and it included Catholics of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman descent. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination within the kingdom of Ireland, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king, Charles I. Most Confederates professed loyalty to Charles I and believed they could reach a lasting settlement with the king once his opponents in the English Civil War had been defeated. The Confederacy had what were effectively a parliament (called the General Assembly), an executive (called the Supreme Council), and a military. It minted coins, levied taxes and set up a printing press. Confederate ambassadors were appointed and recognised in France, Spain and the Papal States, who supplied the Confederates with money and weapons. Your answer: ",

It causes Lyme disease, also called Lyme borreliosis, a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by ticks and by lice, depending on the species of bacteria. The genus is named after French biologist Amédée Borrel (1867–1936), who first documented the distinction between a species of \"Borrelia\", \"B. anserina\", and the other known type of spirochete at the time, \"Treponema pallidum\". This bacterium must be viewed using dark-field microscopy, which make the cells appear white against a dark background. \"Borrelia\" species are grown in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium. Of 52 known species of \"Borrelia\", 21 are members of the Lyme disease group, 29 belong to the relapsing fever group, and two are members of a genetically distinct third group typically found in reptiles. The Lyme disease group has been moved to their own genus, \"Borelliella\", but this change is not yet widely accepted. This bacterium uses hard and soft ticks and lice as vectors.

The system used VHS tape technology to present movie-like gaming experiences. With the system picked up by Hasbro, production of \"Night Trap\" commenced.

Text: The Empire of Trebizond, or Trapezuntine Empire, was a monarchy and one of three successor rump states of the Byzantine Empire that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia (the Pontus) and the southern Crimea. The empire was formed in 1204 with the help of the Georgian queen Tamar after the Georgian expedition in Chaldia and Paphlagonia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople. Alexios later declared himself Emperor and established himself in Trebizond (modern day Trabzon, Turkey). Alexios and David Komnenos, grandsons and last male descendants of deposed Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, pressed their claims as \"Roman Emperors\" against Byzantine Emperor Alexios V Doukas. The later Byzantine emperors, as well as Byzantine authors, such as George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras and to some extent Trapezuntines such as John Lazaropoulos and Basilios Bessarion, regarded the emperors of Trebizond as the \"princes of the Lazes\", while the possession of these \"princes\" was also called Lazica, in other words, their state was known as the Principality of the Lazes. Thus from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Laskaris and later with the Palaiologos dynasties, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors. Your answer: ",

The Despotate of Epirus had ceased to contest the Byzantine throne even before the Nicaean reconquest and was briefly occupied by the restored Byzantine Empire , thereafter becoming a Serbian dependency later inherited by Italians, ultimately falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1479. Whilst the Empire of Nicaea had restored the Byzantine Empire through restoring control of the capital, it ended in 1453 with the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. Trebizond lasted until 1461 when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered it after a month-long siege and took its ruler and his family into captivity, marking the final end of the Roman imperial tradition initiated by Augustus 1,488 years previously. The Crimean Principality of Theodoro, an offshoot of Trebizond, lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in 1475. Your answer: ",

Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's, restored the original text and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama.

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

    "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use a few examples:\nText: OneRepublic is an American pop rock band formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2002. It consists of lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Ryan Tedder, guitarists Zach Filkins and Drew Brown, bassist and cellist Brent Kutzle, drummer Eddie Fisher and keyboardist Brian Willett. The band achieved its first commercial success on Myspace as an unsigned act. In late 2002, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, several record labels approached the band with interest, but the band signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album was released. The lead single of that album, \"Apologize\", was released on April 30, 2006, on Myspace and received some recognition there, becoming number one on the Myspace charts.

It causes Lyme disease, also called Lyme borreliosis, a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted primarily by ticks and by lice, depending on the species of bacteria. The genus is named after French biologist Amédée Borrel (1867–1936), who first documented the distinction between a species of \"Borrelia\", \"B. anserina\", and the other known type of spirochete at the time, \"Treponema pallidum\". This bacterium must be viewed using dark-field microscopy, which make the cells appear white against a dark background. \"Borrelia\" species are grown in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium. Of 52 known species of \"Borrelia\", 21 are members of the Lyme disease group, 29 belong to the relapsing fever group, and two are members of a genetically distinct third group typically found in reptiles. The Lyme disease group has been moved to their own genus, \"Borelliella\", but this change is not yet widely accepted. This bacterium uses hard and soft ticks and lice as vectors.

    "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use a few examples:\nText: The narrative takes as its literal subject the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward, and describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise or Heaven. Allegorically the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (\"Inferno\"), followed by the penitent Christian life (\"Purgatorio\"), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (\"Paradiso\"). Dante draws on medieval Roman Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the \"Summa Theologica\" of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the \"Divine Comedy\" has been called \"the \"Summa\" in verse\". In Dante's work, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil (who represents human reason), Beatrice (who represents divine revelation, theology, faith, and grace), and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother). Erich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues; this along with the fully imagined world of the \"Divine Comedy\", different from our own but fully visualized, suggests that the \"Divine Comedy\" could be said to have inaugurated realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction.

Text: Despite the obstacles, readers and commentators have reached a broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, and their three children Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished closing line, making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text \"La Scienza Nuova\" (The New Science), upon which they argue \"Finnegans Wake\" is structured.

Text: In early 1795, intervention by the French Republic led to the downfall of the old Dutch Republic. The new Republic enjoyed widespread support from the Dutch populace and was the product of a genuine popular revolution. Nevertheless, it clearly was founded with the armed support of the French revolutionary forces. The Batavian Republic became a client state, the first of the \"sister-republics\", and later part of the French Empire of Napoleon. Its politics were deeply influenced by the French, who supported no fewer than three \"coups d'état\" to bring the different political factions to power that France favored at different moments in its own political development. Nevertheless, the process of creating a written Dutch constitution was mainly driven by internal political factors, not by French influence, until Napoleon forced the Dutch government to accept his brother, Louis Bonaparte, as monarch.

Along with the Minnesota Lynx, the club was established in 1999 as part of the league's expansion from ten to twelve teams. The Miracle, the club's previous moniker, originated that year in Orlando, Florida, as the sister team to the NBA's Orlando Magic. Financial straits left the Miracle teetering on the brink of disbanding before the Mohegan Indian tribe purchased and relocated the team to Mohegan Sun, becoming the first Native American tribe to own a professional sports franchise. The derivative of the club's name comes from its affiliation with Mohegan Sun, while the team's logo is reflective of a modern interpretation of an ancient Mohegan symbol. Your answer: ",

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history. After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP \"Baghdad\" (1991), The Offspring signed with Epitaph Records and released two albums for the independent label, \"Ignition\" (1992) and \"Smash\" (1994). \"Smash\", which contained the band's first major hit \"Come Out and Play\", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over eleven million copies worldwide. The success of \"Smash\" attracted attention from major labels, including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring had signed in 1996; their first album for the label, \"Ixnay on the Hombre\" (1997), did not match the success of its predecessor, but received critical acclaim and gold and platinum awards. The band's fifth album, \"Americana\" (1998), regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio, and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: \"Conspiracy of One\" (2000), \"Splinter\" (2003), \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008), \"Days Go By\" (2012) and \"Let the Bad Times Roll\" (2021).

He is one of the most re-imagined characters in children's literature. His story has been adapted into many other media, notably the 1940 Disney film \"Pinocchio\". Collodi often used the Italian Tuscan dialect in his book. The name \"\" is a combination of the Italian words \"\" (pine), and \"occhio\" (eye); \"Pino\" is also an abbreviation of \"Giuseppino\", the diminutive for Giuseppe (the Italian form of Joseph); one of the men who greatly influenced Collodi in his youth was Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist who supervised Collodi at the \"Libreria Piatti\" bookshop in Florence. Geppetto, the name of Pinocchio's creator and “father,” is the diminutive for Geppo, the Tuscan pronunciation of \"ceppo\", meaning a log, stump, block, stock or stub.

    "Your task is extracting knowledge triples from text. A knowledge triple consists of three elements: subject - predicate - object. Subjects and objects are entities and the predicate is the relation between them. Let's use a few examples:\nText: Necochea is a port and beach city in the southwest of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The city is located on the Atlantic coast, along the mouth of the Quequén Grande River, from Buenos Aires and southwest of Mar del Plata. The city proper has 90,000 inhabitants per the and is the seat of government for Necochea Partido. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Necochea', 'Buenos Aires Province', 'Atlantic', 'Quequén Grande River', 'Buenos Aires', 'Mar del Plata', 'seat of government', 'Necochea Partido'] What do you know about the entities? ['Seat of government is a/an concept.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['location', 'mouth of the watercourse', 'capital'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Quequén Grande River', 'Mouth of the watercourse', 'Atlantic'], ['Atlantic', 'location', 'Necochea'], ['Necochea Partido', 'Capital', 'Necochea'], ['Necochea', 'Location', 'Necochea Partido'], ['seat of government', 'capital', 'Mar del Plata']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Atlantic', 'location', 'Necochea'], ['seat of government', 'capital', 'Mar del Plata']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - location - does not hold between Atlantic and Necochea.', 'The relation - capital - does not hold between seat of government and Mar del Plata.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Necochea', 'Location', 'Necochea Partido'], ['Quequén Grande River', 'Mouth of the watercourse', 'Atlantic'], ['Necochea Partido', 'Capital', 'Necochea']].\nText: The Pichilemu area was long populated by the indigenous Promaucaes. European-Chilean development began in the mid-sixteenth century, as \"conquistador\" Pedro de Valdivia gave Juan Gómez de Almagro the Topocalma encomienda (which included the current territory of Pichilemu) in January 1541. Pichilemu was established as a subdelegation on 16 August 1867, and later as an \"autonomous commune\" on 22 December 1891, by decree of the President Jorge Montt and Interior Minister Manuel José Irarrázabal. Agustín Ross Edwards, a Chilean politician and member of the Ross Edwards family, planned to develop it as a beach resort on the Pacific Ocean for upper-class Chileans. Let's extract the entities first. Here is the list of the entities in this text: ['Pichilemu', 'Promaucaes', 'conquistador', 'Pedro de Valdivia', 'January 1541', '16 August 1867', '22 December 1891', 'Jorge Montt', 'Agustín Ross Edwards', 'Ross Edwards family', 'Chileans'] What do you know about the entities? ['Conquistador is a/an concept.', '16 august 1867 is a/an date.', '22 december 1891 is a/an date.'] Now we think about the potential relations between these entities: ['occupation'] Let's make a draft of the triples. [['Pedro de Valdivia', 'occupation', 'conquistador'], ['Ross Edwards family', 'occupation', 'conquistador'], ['Pedro de Valdivia', 'Occupation', 'conquistador']] Now it is time to think and filter out incorrect triples if there is any. The following triples seem to be incorrect: [['Pedro de Valdivia', 'occupation', 'conquistador'], ['Ross Edwards family', 'occupation', 'conquistador']]. Here is the reason why I think these triples are incorrect: ['The relation - occupation - does not hold between Pedro de Valdivia and conquistador.', 'The relation - occupation - does not hold between Ross Edwards family and conquistador.'] Therefore, final triples should be: [['Pedro de Valdivia', 'Occupation', 'conquistador']].\nText: The Danish West Indies () or Danish Antilles or Danish Virgin Islands was a Danish colony in the Caribbean, consisting of the islands of Saint Thomas with ; Saint John () with ; and Saint Croix with . The islands have belonged to the United States since they were purchased in 1917.

Keep track of your thinking as shown in the example and extract triples from the following text. Text: Located on the Brunswick Peninsula north of the Strait of Magellan, Punta Arenas was originally established by the Chilean government in 1848 as a tiny penal colony to assert sovereignty over the Strait. During the remainder of the 1800s, Punta Arenas grew in size and importance due to the increasing maritime traffic and trade travelling to the west coasts of South and North America. This period of growth also resulted from the waves of European immigrants, mainly from Croatia and Russia attracted to the gold rush and sheep farming boom in the 1880s and early 1900s. The largest sheep company, controlling 10,000 square kilometres in Chile and Argentina, was based in Punta Arenas, and its owners lived there. Your answer: "
