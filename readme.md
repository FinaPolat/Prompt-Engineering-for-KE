Testing Prompt Engineering Methods for Knowledge Extraction from Text
=====================================================================

This project is structured into three distinct modules:

1. Data Module
---------------
This module includes scripts for:
- Downloading and preprocessing data
- Creating prompt templates
- Populating these prompt templates with actual data

2. Inference Module
---------------------
This module provides scripts to:
- Perform inference using OpenAI API calls
- Utilize LangChain and Huggingface API calls

3. Evaluation Module
---------------------
This module contains code for:
- Postprocessing extracted data
- Evaluating extracted triples

Each module has its own README file with detailed explanations and instructions on how to run the code. For more information on reproducing our results, please refer to the README file in the respective module.
